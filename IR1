Act east policy
Key difference
-Look East Policy
1.Driven by economic interests
2.Limited to South East Asia
-Act East Policy
1.Driven by Economic and Security interests
2.More extended :: South East Asia + East Asia [Mongolia recently added]
3.Underlines current geopolitics of the region
Indian government launched the 'look east' policy in the early nineties. It was aimed to shift India's focus from the west and neighbours to the booming South East Asian economies. It also intended to spur economic growth in the north east. The government in 2015, upgraded it to 'act east' policy. The foundation, objective remain the same but to provide impetus and increase its importance and focus on it, the policy was upgraded.
Its merits are :
1) It makes the North east an integral part of India's foreign policy. The region will be the main beneficiary and primary actor in the policy.
2) It identifies the economic and geo-political importance of South East Asian countries.
3) Since North east presently is our only access point to other nations through the land route, it utilises this.
4) The importance of infrastructure development, connecting markets and increasing trade is emphasised in the policy.
Some of its limitations are :
1) It neglects the role of Myanmar. The stability in the country is taken for granted. Unless we have a stable and cooperative Myanmar, this policy will not take off.
2) The issue of smuggling of drugs, goods and arms if we open our north east is not addressed.
3) The indirect access China would get through Myanmar is another concern.
4) The North eastern states have not been taken into confidence or given room to participate in the implementation of the policy.

->AIIB (Asia infra investment bank)
-leaded by China
- primarily aimed at bridging the huge gap in infrastructure lending for Asian countries 
- to materializing larger Chinese dream of 'One Road.one belt' project.
-AIIB have more than 21 countries as its partner
-to fund the infrastructure development in Asia and around regions
-China opposed the conditions that bretton woods institutions impose on borrowers, arguing that these conditions violate a countries’ sovereignty
-Critics says removing condition will increase bankruptcy by nations
-Developed with Chinese intention to further their eco and strategic interest vis a vis Maritime silk route

->Bretton woods have failed to reform itself to serve need of the modern time.
->Both are being seen as China's attempt to counter IMF and World bank.
->other development bank led by the Shanghai Co-operation Organization 
->currency reserve fund to cushion nations 

->Diff with IMF and WB
-limited to Asia territory only not to whole world
-loan only for infra related activities
-Dont cater to requirement for BOP crisis , soft loan, financial grants for ambitious projects for humanity like MDG goals , environment etc.
-Dont overdominated by developed world unlike IMF and WB.
-As IMF is dominated Europe , US dominates WB, China will be new Leader
+ve (for world economy)
-Removal of infrastructural bottlenecks of Asian countries will integrate hitherto under performing regions.
-Will boost trade for asian regional forms like SAARC , ASEAN etc.
-alternate to bretnwood system can compel them to reform IMF/SB to give equals rights to developing nation.
-In aftermath of 2008 crisis,when economic slowdown and austerity measures are rampant,AIIB emerges as a ray of hope for much needed funding to third world 
-AIIB will ease the Global Scarcity of funding due to drying finances of IMF and WB 
-Overcome constraints imposed by new Basel norms on Banks globally
-Demands generated from Asian infrastructure projects will also boost supply from developed world's economies helping in expediting revival .
- and result will be net gain to the global economy 
-open avenues for global investment as globalization will play as enabling factor here.
-AIIB projects will lead to Newly emerged Asian regions that will be next global destinations for manufacturing,industries and services thus acting as a value addition to the global economy.
-At a time when PPP model in infrastructure is being considered as a failure world wide given huge risks sovereign need to bear,AIIB comes as a boon for poor Asian nations who lack the same. 

-ve
-main thrust behind the establishment of AIIB is in advancing Chinese Economic and geopolitical interests
-some parts of Road initiative are passing through Disputed regions. Also Encircling Country Diplomacy and past experience may cause Suspicion
-funds may not meet demand and may not get cheap funds like WB and IMF
--So Funding will involve chinese political and industrial intervention in target country.


->china/s interest
-to estab political and economical dominance
-infra spending in other countries will indirectly boost china economy and provide solution for its eco slowdown
-will help to estab its regional dominance by fundtion various infra project like MSR.

Comprision with ADB
->Diff
-ADB focuses on five core areas of operations: infrastructure; the 
environment, including climate change; regional cooperation and 
integration; finance sector development; and education
-majority stake holder would be japan in case of ADB and china in AIIB.
-US is supporter of ADB and opposed AIIB on many instances which might reduce the importance of the bank in long run.
-ADB reach to some extent was focussed on asian countries but AIIB outreach looks much bigger as be portrayed till date. (?)

->simillarities
-Membership of both the countries to open to all
-Both proposed as an alternate to IMR or/and WB which are dominated by west.





->ADB
-it has Asia development Fund(ADF) which give loan to backward member nation of ADB at low interet rate
-it is simillar to grant centre givev to special category state
-we can learn from ADF experience that peace+law and order , connectivity, good local administration are key to end disparity within states.

->Germany

w.r.t current refuge crisis
-some week back Germany was hostile to refugee their shelters were being attacked and they were being abused even pepper spray were usedc
-but from last few days things have changed and welcome is there
-is it coz of little girl child body found on the beach.

large number of the attacks on refugee shelters are happening in areas that were once the German Democratic Republic — East Germany. And that is not by chance.

-Post WW2, Germany was divided between East and west Germany. Also the capital Berlin was divided between the 2 blocs leading to formation of East and west Berlin
-west progressed due to capitalism and due to European Recovery program had provided $13 billion for development of entire Europe, primarily West Germany.
-Whereas the Molotov plan to build east Germany was a failure so  many of the east germans started migrating to west Germany. USSR felt  humiliation as having lost to west in terms of development build the Berlin wall in 1961 which divided Berlin.
-Wall had been the clashing point of two ideologies ,east being communist and west being capitalist
-Everything from work culture to food habits and views on working mothers had evolved in different directions.
The Fall of the Berlin Wall was one of the most significant events and a turning point in history. The 28 mile long Berlin Wall was a barrier that divided Berlin from 1961 to 1989. The monstrous wall was constructed across the entire city blocking the escape route of the refugees from East Germany to West Germany, which became a bone of contention for the communist regime.


Events that led to the fall of Berlin Wall:

1. Sinatra Doctrine - the eastern bloc which was not allowed to have connectivity and communication with the west, was now allowed to make their own decisions to a far greater extent through this doctrine.
2. Opening of the Hungarian border - Hungary began to allow people free passage to Austria. East Germans realizing that they could freely travel to Hungary, since it was an Eastern Bloc nation, did so and from there they escaped to the West.
3. Opposition to Soviet rule was growing in places, such as Poland and Czechoslovakia.
4. Churches of East Germany - small groups of people gathered to discuss opposition to the Soviets and to hold small protests. The protests grew in number at an exponential rate.

->Consequences of fall
-Germany acceptest capitalism as a whole and emerged as industrial nation.
-Massive unemployment in east Germany as due to west compitition its factory got closed.
-To compound this, the free movement of labour in the EU brought cheap East European labour, triggering chants of the foreigner “here to take our jobs. this worsned condition in East Germany
-this hurtburn catalysed the Rise of right wing National Democrtic party in former east german states.
-racial attacks against migrants since it caused unemployment.
-Dissolution of USSR occurred in 1991 since other nations also demanded freedom from communist rule. End of communism in Germany.

->The U.N. Security Council officially declared Boko Haram a terrorist group linked to al-Qaeda on Thursday and imposed sanctions against the Islamist extremists who have carried out a wave of deadly attacks and the recent abduction of nearly 300 schoolgirls in Nigeria.

U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power welcomed the council’s action, calling it “an important step in support of the government of Nigeria’s efforts to defeat Boko Haram and hold its murderous leadership accountable for atrocities.”

Nigeria, which is serving a two-year term on the council, asked the Security Council committee monitoring sanctions against al-Qaeda to add Boko Haram to the list of al-Qaeda-linked organizations subject to an arms embargo and asset freeze.

The 14 other council members had until 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT) on Thursday to object and none did. The group was then added to the U.N. sanctions list under the name Jama’atu Ahlus-Sunna Lidda’Awati Wal Jihad, with Boko Haram as an alias.

Quinlan said there’s “very clear evidence” that Boko Haram members have trained with al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, particularly in developing improvised explosive devices “one of the main weapons of modern-day terrorism and particularly al-Qaeda.” There is also evidence that a significant number of Boko Haram members have fought alongside al-Qaeda affiliates in Mali, he said.

Quinlan said Boko Haram’s current leader, Abubakar Shekau, also made “very, very strong statements of ... terrorist solidarity with al-Qaeda in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia” and other places in November 2012.

Before Boko Haram’s addition, the al-Qaeda sanctions list included 62 entities and groups, and 213 individuals who are also subject to travel bans.

Quinlan said it’s hard to say what the practical impact of sanctions against Boko Haram will be. One possible problem in tracking their finances, he said, is that large parts of the group work in the jungle and probably use cash rather than “substantial or sophisticated financial arrangements for banking but you never know.”

Nigeria’s U.N. Ambassador U. Joy Ogwu said Wednesday “the important thing is to attack the problem, and that is terrorism.”

Boko Haram’s 5-year-old Islamic uprising has claimed the lives of thousands of Muslims and Christians, including more than 1,500 people killed in attacks so far this year.

The group, whose name means “Western education is forbidden,” has tried to root out Western influence by targeting schools, churches, mosques, government buildings and security forces. The homegrown terror group was largely contained to the northern part of Nigeria before expanding its reach with the help of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the terrorist network’s affiliate in West Africa.

According to the sanctions committee, Boko Haram is responsible for attacks and kidnappings in Nigeria and Mr. Cameroon and has also been active in Chad and Niger.

At a summit in Paris on Saturday aimed at hammering out a plan to rescue the 276 girls, Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan said Boko Haram was acting “clearly as an al-Qaeda operation”. He only reluctantly accepted outside help after years of insisting that Boko Haram was a local problem.

French President Francois Hollande told the summit that Boko Haram is armed with weapons that came from Libya following the ouster of longtime dictator Muammar Qadhafi in 2011, and the training took place in Mali before the ouster of its al-Qaeda linked Islamist leaders. As for the money, Mr. Hollande said its origins were murky

->Lessons from Brazil Eco Crisis
-Brazil eco mainly depends upon Commodity export like food ,metal but slowness in Chinese 
growth and US has decreases its export
-Inflation is running high so Central bank increasing interest
-High cost of funding -> less industry growth -> less GDP growth
-Habit of indulging in price subsidies,in false hopes of always good times,has structurally 
weakened the economy with ad hoc measures of leftist
-Massive corruption in public sector undertakings specially in oil sector
-Failure to diversify from commodity driven economy to a robust,diverse and sustainable one 
-stalled reforms and uncheck spending/subsidy has increased inflation.
=many Brazilian companies have filed for bankruptcies. and Brazilian Real is depreciating
-
India,being a major commodity importer,service sector oriented economy and with persisting
 problems of CAD,inflation,high consumption subsidies,massive corruption

 ->Bretton woods system -NOTED
Bretton woods played important role in restructuring politics of world like:
-1.	Rise NAM during 1960s-70s.
2.	Bringing Europe back to life after war
3.	Brought Cold War to an end by continuously spreading capitalism against communism in third world
4.	Changed Economy policy of India (coz of IMF liberalization conditions during 1991 BOP crisis)
5.	Integration of World economy with US and European economy.

->Britian EU exist

-the conservative party back to power after it had promised to hold a referendum on Britain's exit from the Europen Union, termed 'Brexit', by 2017
->Why want exist
-The UK contributes between 8 to 20 billion pounds to the EU budget every year. 
-EU has laid down regulations on a number of issues like immigration, agricultural standards etc which conflicts with the sovereign rights
-Immigration, in particular, especially from the eastern European nations has been a major problem for the UK
->Brexit' can impact India in the following ways:
-India has not had very good relationship with the EU. As Britain moves out of EU, India could strengthen trade relationship with Britain.
-Such a move might lead to Scotland also secceeding form the UK as it wants to remain a part of EU. Hence, India would have to recalibrate it relationship with all the members of the UK.
-Since a major reason behind the British desire to exit EU is the immigration policy of EU, after exiting, Britain might have a very strict immigration policy. Since many Indians also move to Britain for studies and employment, this can have a large impact on India.
-India will also need to renegotiate all trade deals with the UK as its previous deals with the EU would no longer apply. Hence, there will be uncertainty in the business environment.

->China White paper on foreign policy

->Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s election confirms that Egypt has a military-guided democracy. But this should not make us jump to the conclusion that it is not democracy at all

Egypt has a new President. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who was the country’s Army chief and Defence Minister, has won a landslide victory in the presidential election held in the last week of May. He defeated his opponent, Hamdeen Sabahi, by securing 96.91 per cent of the votes polled.

Mr. Sisi, 59, is Egypt’s sixth President (not counting interim heads of state), and the fifth with a military background, since the country became a republic in 1953 following the removal of King Farouk by the Army. The only non-military person ever to become Egypt’s elected President was Mohamed Morsi, leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, and now in jail. Mr. Sisi’s election marks both a closure and, perhaps, partial continuation of the strong socio-political turbulence that has gripped Egypt for over three years. It began with a popular uprising in 2011, known as the January 25 Revolution, which brought Mr. Hosni Mubarak’s 30-year-long dictatorial reign to an end. Mr. Morsi was elected in June 2012, only to be unseated from power in July 2013, when he became the target of an even bigger, popular uprising.

 A majority of Egyptians are against religious extremism and prefer peace, safety and stability. 

The yearning for a strong leader

Mr. Sisi’s victory was a foregone conclusion going by the immense popularity he gained after he, as Army chief, backed the huge countrywide protests against Mr. Morsi. He earned the reputation of being a strong leader when he served Mr. Morsi an ultimatum to resign within 48 hours. When the Muslim Brotherhood protested angrily by staging indefinite sit-ins in Cairo squares, he ordered a crackdown by security forces in which nearly a 1,000 of Mr. Morsi’s supporters were killed. He was the de-facto ruler of Egypt even during the reign of the post-Morsi interim government, when a new Constitution was adopted. This is when the Muslim Brotherhood was outlawed and declared a “terrorist organisation.” In the run-up to the presidential poll, Mr. Sisi went to the extent of saying that the Muslim Brotherhood would cease to exist during his presidency.

His election confirms that Egypt has a military-guided democracy. But this should not make us jump to the conclusion that it is not democracy at all, simply military rule in a civilian garb. This is unlikely to happen. The tumultuous events since the overthrow of the hated Mubarak regime have shown that there has been a democratic awakening and activism on a scale unprecedented in Egypt’s history or even Arab history. This mass awakening cannot be suppressed. After his victory, Mr. Sisi has sought to quash apprehensions on this score by saying, “We know that some people fear a return to the past, but this will not happen, there is no going back and we will move forward.”

Many Indians, who cheered the “Arab Spring” in 2011, in this most populous Arab country, are naturally baffled by the subsequent developments. Why did the largely non-violent anti-Mubarak and pro-democracy mass protests at Cairo’s Tahrir Square herald an era of instability? Why did Egyptians return to the same Tahrir Square in even larger numbers to demand Mr. Morsi’s ouster? Why did an Islamist organisation like the Muslim Brotherhood become unpopular so quickly in a country with a 90 per cent Muslim population? Why did Egyptians begin to lionise an ex-Army chief who was an almost unknown figure even two years ago?

Challenges behind the victory

It is to find answers to some of these questions that I spent a week in Egypt in February this year. What I found is that a majority of Egyptians are against religious extremism (hence their anger against Mr. Morsi’s majoritarian and coercive regime) and prefer peace, safety and stability (hence their faith in a military leader who is tough on Islamism but is not against Islam).

Indeed, what endeared Mr. Sisi to most Egyptians, especially women, is the combination of the hard and the soft in his personality. While he responded to their deep yearning for a strong leader capable of bringing order to a nation convulsed by three years of violence and chaos that has wrecked the national economy on the one hand, he came across as a pious Muslim who could touch the hearts of the common people with his soft-spoken and compassionate talk on the other. Moreover, in a country that regards the Army as the supreme and most reliable patriotic institution, many people saw him as a committed defender of Egyptian nationalism, as against the Brotherhood’s call for Islamic internationalism that marginalises Coptic Christians (who account for 10 per cent of the country’s 85 million population) and rejects the glory of Egypt’s pre-Islamic Pharaonic past.

However, Mr. Sisi’s impressive victory margin cannot hide the harsh challenges that are bound to test his presidency. The mandate he has received is somewhat weakened already by the less-than-expected turnout of voters. This was partly due to the fact that since his victory was a certainty, many voters believed that their individual vote would make no material difference to the poll outcome. In an extraordinary move, the Election Commission, finding the turnout to be low in the scheduled two-day poll, extended polling to the third day. Even then, Mr. Sisi could garner only about 24 million votes, out of 54 million registered voters, which fell short of the target of 40 million votes that he had publicly sought.

The low turnout has again shown that the Egypt that Mr. Sisi will lead remains a divided nation. This has emboldened his critics — the Muslim Brotherhood, which had called for a boycott of the poll, and also many non-Islamist democratic forces that were in the vanguard of the anti-Mubarak uprising and who now fear a return to authoritarian Army rule under Mr. Sisi.

Therefore, the main challenge before Mr. Sisi is to forge what he himself has called a “real national partnership that satisfies all Egyptians.” He has made the assurance that “our arms are open for everyone to build the nation.” No less onerous is the other challenge of quickly reviving the national economy, so that the new President can, in his own words, “calm the young.” They are restive because Egypt is reeling under a 13 per cent unemployment rate, with 800,000 fresh arrivals to the job market each year. He has to fix soaring inflation and a crippling budget deficit, almost 14 per cent of GDP. Tourism, a major revenue earner and job-generator, is down to a fourth of its peak levels. Mr. Sisi has repeatedly stated that tourists will not return to Egypt, and investments cannot be speeded up for economic growth unless protests stop and the country is perceived by the rest of the world to be safe and stable. The government has therefore banned public protests. It has also arrested a large number of both liberal-democratic and pro-Brotherhood activists. This has earned Mr. Sisi many critics, at home as well as abroad. However, the new President obviously thinks that in the current situation in Egypt, stability and development must take precedence over certain democratic freedoms.

Rebooting India-Egypt ties

Many Egyptians believe that the restoration of hope is the need of the hour. They despair that Egypt, despite its past glory, is a poor member of the Arab world today. In his book The Real Story of the Egyptian Revolution, Hassan Elsawaf writes: “The contrast between today’s Egypt and what the country used to be is quite evident in a photograph, taken after World War II, that shows King Farouk seated in a comfortable armchair, dignified and self-assured. Surrounding him is a huge group of the offspring of Saudi and other Gulf rulers, all standing in deference to the Egyptian monarch. They all represent the degree of veneration Egypt enjoyed among Gulf Arabs at the time, having saved them from impending famine with generous donations.”

Today, Egypt has to depend on generous aid, worth billions of dollars, from Saudi Arabia and several Gulf states. Mr. Sisi has said that he wants to change this reality. He can succeed if he strongly and simultaneously pursues five guiding principles — of good governance, development, democratic institution-building, containment of religious extremism, and national reconciliation. As the head of a country with which India has always enjoyed friendly relations, we Indians should wish him and the Egyptian people well.

It is a pity that India-Egypt relations have remained at a very low level. Egyptians have enormous goodwill for India and still remember the warmth of the Nehru-Nasser friendship. In contrast, Egypt — and much of the rest of the Arab world, too — has become distant in the national consciousness of Indians. This must change. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a good opportunity to befriend President Sisi now that Egypt has begun increasingly to look for economic and political ties with the non-western countries.

This will also help the Modi government reach out to the larger Muslim world since the march of moderate Islam — of the kind Egypt espouses — will greatly benefit India, our South Asian neighbourhood and the rest of the world.

->indian foreign policy with develope and co-operation
=steps by india in this regards
-developing chabahar port in IRAN -> eco benfits to both iran and India
-119  conti amendment bill to transfer caves with bangladesh
-Cooperation with east asian nation -> providing defence equipment to vietnam
-from look east to act EAst policy to increase cooperation with asean
-FTA with ASEAN nation.effective from 1 jan 2010.
-Investment in afganistan 
-medical missions, fodd assistance, building of Afghan Parliament, 
construction of Delaram Zaranj Highway in Iran for Afghan goods, 
training of Afghan security forces, etc.
-TAPI pipeline
Nepal: Hydroelectric power plants, financial support, funds for restoration 
of pilgimages,
-GAs/LPG subsidiy to Bhutan + other financial assistance
-housing development project in east Srilank to help in rehabilitating tamils
-development of two island in Mauritius
-cooperation with china to solve the boundary issue.

w.r.t west asia we are alienated 
->Reaons
-Being on defensive side wr.t foreign policy and even in international platforms like UN
-India abstained from voting on Libya and did not oppose when the West pushed for regime change
-India did not raise voice against IS Congress's decision to arm moderate Syriam rebels 
-India voted against IRan under US pressure even after having engagement like chabar port and Delaram Highway.
-Silence on The Palestine issue.
-Not a much active party in Afgan post NATO withdrawl even after sutantial investments
-Not in Iran issue , iraq issue
-Dialogues with 'influencers' in the region instead of regional powers:

imprtance of west asia
-enery -70% oil import
-national security
-huge domestic islamic population -> internal security
-Trade route security to west asia and EU,US like rice etc
-Keeping a check on Jehadi elements. like Iran major role to tame ISIS




->IBSA
-India Brazil SA in 2006
-for the want of reforming UN Security Council and to discuss climate change
-has languished ever since and not played any prominent role becuase of following reasons:
1. Elevation of G20 as a platform for discussion on global economic issues.
2. Most importantly, the rise of BRICS which has IBSA plus Russia and China.
 BRICS seems to be a body of action as is evident from its declarations, occasional anti-West agenda and formation of a BRICS bank.
 
 IBSA remains mostly a passive organization but needs to be revived for multiple reasons:
1. The three nations represent three vibrant democracies from three developing continents, each one the fce of it and ech one being a multicultural, multi ethnic society. So they are together the Global South.
2. Apart from aspiring the permanent seats in UNSC, these nations have much to discuss in common interests like climate change, money laundering, drug trafficking and terrorism.
3. All three lie have coastlines which can be leveraged for maritime development. India is in Indian Ocean, Brazil in southern Atlantic and South Africa in between the two.
4. There are lot of synergies and complementaries between these nations. Like India has land resource crunch while Brazil is land rich. India and South Africa share a cultural and heritage link due to Gandhiji and Nelson Mandela. 
5. All are feeling the heat of Chinese economic hegemony in their respective neighbourhoods, be it Asia, Africa or Latin America. China would want IBSA to be dissolved as IBSA did not invite China at its member.
-China has moved too far away, further its assertiveness will never make it a cooperating partner of equal terms in any such multilateral cooperation
So there are enought incentives for IBSA to be revived and India, being the economic powerhouse of this group, can play a leading role to this end by taking the initiative in the next IBSA summit. 


->India and China
--Tibet issue
-Relation may come to fore when question of successor of Dalai Lama comes in
-China believes:
1. Tibetan Autonomous Region is historically an ethnically mixed region, so no
 question of separate homeland.
2. Tibetan civilization was never unified under a single Tibetan ruler, whether
 Dalai Lama or Panchen Lama.
3. Tibet has attributed to neo-liberal reforms and the penetration of market 
relations to all aspects of Chinese life.
4. Chinese society has grown economically, covering all ethnic populations.
and it sees Tibet dispora as long term threat to its control over tibet.with good
 population residing in India
Indian option
-Resolve all dispute before sucession issues comes up
-bring dispora to table with china govt and let me put their demand
-involve UN and international community for amicable solution
-We have already accepted chinese sovereignty over Tibet so no other way.
Dalia lama has suggested he not going to choose his incarnation which has
 infuriated China (why?)

Dalai Lama Middle path approach
-- As Tibetans don't accept current status of the Tibet under the China. But they also do not seek independence for Tibet. Thus Dalai Lama's Middle Path advocates to peacefully resolve the issue 
- genuine autonomy for all Tibetans within the framework of the People's Republic of China.
- democratic rule of administration for their provinces. It will never seek separation and allows limited Chinese military.
-centre state subject.
- It is Win-Win-Win strategy where 3rd stakeholder being the neighbours countries major being India.
1). For Tibetans: the protection and preservation of their culture, religion and national identity; 
2). For the Chinese: the security and territorial integrity of the motherland; 
3). For neighbour countries: peaceful borders and better international relations to boost economic relation.
- As China rejected the Middle Path & called it propaganda to achieve independence is a major setback for India. reaons for rejection
-dangerous will encourage pro democracy forces in china
-many other region may raise their voice for such settlement
-can have -ve impact on its socialist principles.
- Allowing Dalai Lama exile in India, seen as major bone of contention, as Chinese view it as India interference in their internal issue.
- Also the Path would brought peace in its N-E Area and thus provided major thrust for economic development of the area.


China pak eco corridor
-Pakistani Government to provide proper security to Chinese personnel working for infrastructure
-CPEC will create jobs, increase infrastructure and opportunities for youths in Pakistan. It will definitely constraint flow of youth towards Pakistan’s fundamentalist group
--can also help in keeping nation united in situation of grave sectarian crisis
+ve for india
-One Pakistan is better than two-three divided mini-Pakistans for India’s safe and steady progress.
-Commitments to China will put pressure on surging of Radical groups
-deployment of security personal to secure this corridor will help to check infiltration
-will be connected to silk route so can open new asia market for India
-	India can openly & easily engage with Vietnam and other ASEAN nations to counter-weight Chinese moves in India Ocean
Negatives for India :
1.	POK, an Indian territory will used in CPEC, it is a challenge to sovereignty of India.
2.	Chinese naval vessels will frequently confront Indian Naval vessels due to Gwadar Port.
3.	Influence of China and Pakistan will increase in Afghanistan bad for India's investments there.
-china internal motive could be increasing its influence and decreasing US could be harmful for our aspirations


issues
- huge trade deficit, which has risen to a whopping $37.8 bn. China’s economy is almost four times the size of India and their official military budget ($119 billion) is three times larger than ours
-
-China says the border dispute is confined only to 2,000 km mostly in Arunachal Pradesh whereas India asserts that the dispute covered the western side of the border spanning to about 4,000 km, especially the Aksai Chin area annexed by China in the 1962 war

Namo China visit [May 15]
1) India - China forum for states/provinces - It is a watershed agreement in Indian foreign affairs. It identifies the importance of states and provides them avenues for interaction with foreign nations. Moreover, since critical inputs such as land, labour and infrastructure come under their ambit, it has economic significance.
2) E-visas to Chinese nationals - However, there are certain security concerns.
3) Space cooperation -agreement to cooperate in space travel, research and development. 
4) Military confidence building measures - Hotline between local commanders to deal with critical issues on the border, joint defence exercises and decided to increase high level visits. Though it keeps the border dispute unresolved.
5) People to people ties - Several agreements in this regard have been signed. Sister cities between Bangalore, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and corresponding Chinese cities. Yoga training in Chinese university. Joint production of movies. Agreement between prasad Bharathi and CCTV.
6) Economy - infrastructure agreements to tap Chinese expertise and capital. Agreement on high speed trains and infrastructure corridors in Gujarat and Maharashtra. These have improved Chinese confidence in investing in India.
7) China to invest over $20B in India


->China Deng Xiaoping  role
-in making a shift from an orthodox communist doctrines and help its economy incorporate elements of the free-enterprise system led to foundation of modern china
-adopted 'market socialism' i.e socialism based on supply and demand,price fixed by market.This was in contrast to earlier Mao policy
-From a self- reliant economic focus, export oriented economy gained primary importance
-planning by technically -efficient bureaucrats
-Huge investments were made by local provinces into the most profitable businesses locally,encouraging light manufacturing which required less capital
-relation with technologically advance countries in the West and Japan were improved
-A series of special economic zones were set up to attract foreign companies  by giving cheap land and labour and cutting down red-tapism

However, modern China seems to have moved away from the Deng's philosophy ,particularly on political and foreign policy matters
-Contrary to the Deng's led initiative of 'hide our capacities and bide our time modern china is assertive
-Contrary to Deng's policy of 'be good at maintaining a low profile' and 'never claim leadership', the new China seeks greater leadership role 


->China One Belt One Road
--China attempt to revive its old silk route and make sea,road  connectivity(by building ports in different countries) with Europe,middle east,south asia and africa
-consists of two main components, the land-based "Silk Road Economic Belt" (SREB) and oceangoing "Maritime Silk Road" (MSR)
-SREB encompasses trade and investment by reaching out to Eurasia with the road extending via Myanmar to India whereas MSR traverses around Indian ocean in reaching African and European nations.
-SREB involves investment in fixed assets like pipelines, raods and rail lines. China had already committed for huge investments for these infrastructure. This is also in synergy with India's Act East Policy and BCIM corridor. India needs to leverage on the Chinese investments and decrease the trade deficit.
Benefits to India
-Can complement our project Sagarmal and project Mausum
-Will provide us access to huge market
-China want to connect india through BCIM(Bangladesh,china,india,mynmar) it will proivde as boon to NE region and strength our act east policy

and middle east bypassing pak. and help as an route to landlocked afgan without pak.
-also this port will be connected to afgan through rail link (>) so alernate sea connectivity for
them ,currently they solely depends on Karachi port

-Today, the Afghan Pakistan Transit and Trade Agreement (APTTA) is seen as a barrier because of delays at the borders, restrictions on vehicles, and Afghan trucks having to return empty as they are barred from picking up Indian goods
-expedite chabar port development in iran to give afgan an alternate trade route
-we want stable, united, independent and democratic Afghanistan where all its ethnic groups live and prosper together
-India has to be aware of the fact that Afghanistan wooing China for investments so that pak might contain Taliban activity in Afghanistan. This is in India's interests as it has invested much in rebuilding the country and pledged 14.5$billion in iron ore mining.

-Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declared independence and the formation of Bangladesh. Lt Gen Tikka Khan launched a genocide, calling it Operation Blitz. Ten million refugees fled to India, and the army’s violence led to the creation of Mukti Bahini, a liberation force.India hosted training camps for Bengali guerrillas of the Mukti Bahini to venture into East Pakistan, there to attack army camps and disrupt communications.
-Earlier indian was providing military,economy and diplomatical support to Bangladesh guerrillas But when pak attacked our northen cities its direct involvement become obvious. and on 16 December pak army was forced to surrender.

-On the diplomatic front treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation was signed between the Soviet Union and India to safeguard India’s interests during the conflict.
Consequencies:-
-The victory over Pakistan unleashed a huge wave of patriotic sentiment. It was hailed as ‘India’s first military victory in centuries.
-The prime minister, and her party, naturally sought to make political capital of what the soldiers had accomplished. In March 1972 fresh elections were called in thirteen states. In all thirteen, the Congress won comfortably.

Positive aspects :-
-Almost all central Asian countries are friendly ties with India.
-mutual relations between Afghan and India is characterized by deep engagement,counter terrorism cooperation and training of Afghan forces , credit , aids and assistances by India in development of roads,housing and schools and other infrastructure etc 
-relations with energy rich belt of Central Asian nations ,gas pipeline , thwart terrorism
Limitations / negative aspects and future potentials:
1. relations under developed due to several geo-political factors and obstacles .area sucn as trade route and energy not fully exploited
2. Pakistan ,a gateway to central Asia for India remain unwilling and key hurdle in connecting Afghanistan .
3.The International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) INSTC that includes rail, road, and water transport from Mumbai in India via Bandar Abbas in Iran to Moscow in Russia remained unexplored . 
-due to lack of a viable trade route, the overall Indian engagement has not utilised the potential
-Turkmenistan-Afganistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline for gas, the actual implemenation is mired in the instability of the region

->'Connect Central Asia' Policy in 2012 [By India]
-to ensure a holistic approach to improving relationship with the CAR. However, the policy has not been able to achieve complete success due to following reasons -
1. Lack of a viable trade route 
2. The sanctions imposed on Iran by the western nations has proved a major hindrance in the development of the Chabahar port by India which is the lynchpin of connectivity with CAR.


->The ban imposed by the European Union on the import of Alphonso mangoes and four varieties of vegetables from India until December 2015 after some consignments were found infested with “non-European fruit flies” has naturally upset India. As the biggest producer of the golden fruit, India sends about 70,000 tonnes of mangoes abroad every year. Yet, merely insisting that the 28-member bloc’s action is “unilateral… without any meaningful official consultation,” as Commerce Minister Anand Sharma has done, will not do. The EU had notified India in March of its concerns. Whether the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority, which is tasked with ensuring that items of export are compliant in terms of sanitary and phyto-sanitary standards as set down by importing countries, was able to fully address them effectively, remains unclear. It is also to be noted that scores of consignments of mangoes and vegetables shipped in 2013 had been found to be contaminated. Periodic problems that come up with respect to shrimp exports over contamination concerns, are relevant here. India certainly needs to put in place fool-proof mechanisms for the examination and certification of export commodities to remove such taints once and for all. Necessary correctives need to be worked out with the involvement of technical and scientific bodies in order that in the lucrative but competitive export markets the country would establish its reputation as a reliable partner meeting health and phyto-sanitary standards.

On its part, the EU should ensure that any cause for a perception of its decision being an unfair one which smacks of a punitive approach and that would potentially jeopardise India-EU trade, is avoided. As the Minister has pointed out, the ongoing negotiations for a broad-based India-EU trade and investment agreement is based on the premise of trust and understanding to put in place a more liberal trade regime. Brussels should note Indian domestic concerns and invoke the necessary correctives on the basis of an appropriate assessment of risks. If it is indeed possible that sections of the EU bureaucracy see here a leveraging factor in the context of talks on a Free Trade Agreement, as also other bilateral issues, that will amount to unfairness. Although Europe is not a major market for Indian mangoes — it accounts for 16 million tonnes annually — any ban typically pulls down prices. About 80 per cent of the exports from India go to West Asia. What India should do is to strengthen its bargaining position by raising export standards and leave no quarter to be found remiss. The entire ecosystem for exports, involving farmers, packers and exporters of agri-commodities, should be geared to meet the quality and safety requirements of countries across the world.

REasons for low rel with EU
Economic factors
-EU ban on aplhonso mangoes
-East asia has overtaken EU as the largest trading partner
-only few countries of EU account for the maximum amount of trade and FDI
- on-going Eurozone crisis has greatly undermined India's confidence

-issues of 2 italine marines being persecuted in India
-Structure -> EU is complex organization and over-institutionalized and over-bureaucratized so less attractive to engage with
-political and strategic factors:
	-US: has significant military and non-military partnerships with India
	- desire to find a permanent place on the UNSC, it is not the EU but the existing European permanent members, the UK and France, who bring more value to the table
	- EU has next to nothing to contribute to her energy demand or other principal security interests
	-EU's reluctance to provide India with strategic dual use technology has pushed India into a closer huddle with the US and other European countries like France
	-Given the lack of cohesion among the EU constituents on strategic issues, India prefers establishing bilateral relations rather than dealing with the EU as a whole
