->India and Iran
-Recently May 2015 both signed MOU on chabar port despite US reservation on same.

India’s Perspective on Chabar port.:-
-will provide access to Afghanistan’s Garland Highway using the existing Iranian network and the Zaranj-Delaram road, constructed by India in 2009. This would provide direct access to four of the major cities of Afghanistan 
-This port will be used by India to ship crude oil and urea which will cut transport cost and freight time for India to Central Asia and the gulf by about a third.
-The trade route reduces India dependence on Pakistan, a volatile neighbor, for trade with Afghanistan.
-To counter china developing pak Gwadar port.
Iran’s Perspective:-
-One of Iran’s strategic weaknesses is its lack of deep-water ports. Iran’s southern ports, such as Bandar Abbas which handles 85 percent of Iranian seaborne trade, can only receive 100,000 ton cargo ships. Since most shipping is conducted via 250,000 ton cargo vessels, cargo must first be offloaded in the United Arab Emirates and then sent on smaller ships which can dock in Iran. Chabahar port will be a boost to their trade.
-Besides US objections and international sanctions imposed on Iran, India went ahead with this deal to improve the Iran’s economy. A friend in need.
-Iran’s also want to give a proof to the world regarding its cooperation and demanding removal of internationally imposed sanctions.
-Due to sanctions and other reasons Iran’s export over the years has reduced drastically which has affected its revenues. This deal will bring foreign investments and hence enriching the economy.

->-> Indo-Mongolian cooperation is limited to diplomatic visits, provision of soft loans and financial aid and the collaborations in the IT sector
-> India established diplomatic relations in 1955
-> India was the first country outside the Soviet block to establish diplomatic relations with Mongolia
-> Since then, there have been treaties of mutual friendship and cooperation between the two countries in 1973, 1994, 2001 and 2004
-Nomadic elephant  is a joint military exercise between India and mongoliya.both have agreed to cooperate in defence.
-> Mongliya stood with India in case of UN resolution supporting Bangladesh as an independent state ignoring its neighbor pakistan. Mongoliya support india for permanent seat in UN security council.while India supported the inclusion of Mongolia as a full member of the Non-Aligned Movement
-Mongoliya has transformed herself for a better democracy through ages. It has joined many peace initiatives with UN.
-> Though India and Mongolia signed a civilian nuclear deal for uranium supplies way back in 2009, unfortunately India is still awaiting its first uranium supply from Mongolia. That’s because the Mongolian internal processes are still to be completed and uranium supplies are bogged down
-Bilateral treaties have been signed between the countries regarding trade and mineral exploration.
-> Mongolia has never been on the radar screens of any Indian Prime Minister from Jawahar Lal Nehru onwards. But our current PM will change this forever when on 17 May he spends one night in Ulan Bator, the Mongolian capital
area of cooperation
-Due to lack of technology ; mongoliya derives its energy from coal mainly leading to serious environmental and health problems.india can help in solar engery
-cultural The root of buddhism binds the two countries culturally
-tapping of its natural resources. it will get Money and we will get required raw material

Foreign policy experts believe that forget Uranium as has enough foreign resources now to get this precious metal, the real reason behind upcoming visit to Mongolia is China:

-> Mongolia may be a giant sized country but it is dwarfed by two much bigger giants between which it is sandwiched: China and Russia
-> Mongolia is keen to open up to the world in a big way and is ill at ease with Chinese influence, economically and politically, though it is largely due to its geographical proximity to China with which it shares borders
-> For this reason, Mongolia wants to put in place its "third neighbor" policy aimed at invigorating ties with India and expanding its foreign policy and business outreach to India and look beyond China and Russia
-> Strategically and diplomatically speaking, India and Mongolia bring much to the table for each other. Mongolia is the world’s second largest land-locked country — after Kazakhstan. It is rich in mineral resources like copper, iron, coal and uranium
-> For these reasons, China has traditionally eyed the Mongolian markets. But the style of functioning of Chinese companies has triggered concern among the people and the political elite alike in Mongolia
-> So much so that increasing number of Mongolian politicians and political parties are getting visibly affected by Sino-phobia
-> Against this backdrop, it is understandable that “anti-China-ism” is gaining traction among increasing number of Mongolian politicians and the Mongolian media often runs highly critical news stories about China
-> Defence and security are increasingly becoming a new focus in India-Mongolia bilateral engagement
-> In many ways, Mongolia offers a newer opportunity and strategic leverage for India in dealing with China – Vietnam, Philippines and Myanmar being the old ones

problems
-crucial neighbour to china  So; challenge to India lies in balancing this factor.
-infra problem in Mongolia is big hinderance to trade
-this being landlocked country so also trade problems
-The growing relationship between china and Russia and mongolia as a buffer zone between them creates challenges to India.


miscellenous info
-Mangol parliament known as Great Khural (May 15 it celebrated 25 years of democracy)
-Mongolia name came from tribe whose leader Ghengis khan(he also came to india) beagan a conquest to establish large emprire   in 13th centuary from asia to europe.
-important to US pivot asia policy.coz proximity to north korea and afganistan.


->india_Mynanmar

w.r.t NE
-North eastern sister states share longest border with Mynanmar.
-stability in Mynamar important for NE progress
-security challenges particularly around regions of Nagaland, Manipur & Arunachal Pradesh have a strong Myanmar link
-Myanmar is semi-democratic and military ruled nation where the taste of Constitutional Democracy is yet to come. This army dominated government(more than 80% parliamenterian are army officers) always supported North eastern extremists and make their border porous for arms supply, smuggling.
-Recent case of red sander, rhino horn and poached animals are found to reach China through Myanmar only.
-Persecution of Minority Rohingya Muslim by majority Buddhists also a reason of increased infiltration along the border.
-Relations between Khaplang(North east extremists group), ULFA(United Liberation Front of Assam), NSCN (National Socialist Council of Nagaland) and the Myanmar government have been on the upswing in last decade with various proof of securing hideouts for wanted criminals/extremists of North east in Myanmar.
-Myanmar army dominated govt also supports seccessionist forces of North east for their personal gains like smuggling, arms/ammunition supply etc. Myanmar government has entered into an five point agreement with Khaplang faction of NSCN; which includes ceasefire, freedom of movement for unarmed cadres in Myanmar and opening liaison office to facilitate talks; proving Myanmar's active involvement in India's northeastern problem. Such goodwill gestures to Rebel group will further erodes the long form trust and diplomacy between India and Myanmar.

Rohingya problem
The Rohingya are a Muslim minority ethnic to Myanmar living in western part of the country. 
- Myanmar's citizenship laws deny them citizenship rights and treats them to be illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.
- persecution within Myanmar at the hands of the Buddhist majority.
-In order to escape this persecution Rohingyas try to enter the neighboring countries including Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and India via land/sea routes.
- most countries are reluctant to consider the Rohingyas as refugees and often label them as economic migrants. generally pushed back as often considered to a socio-economic and security threat. Make them vulnerable to trafficking, prostitution and forced labour.
-India has taken a humanitarian approach to the influx of the Rohingyas. In fact, alongside Malaysia, India is the only country in the region which grants refugee status to Rohingyas.
- While, some Rohingyas has managed to enter India undetected via Bangladesh, a vast majority are detained under the Foreigners Act, 1946 and are sent to the Tihar jail, over which the UNHCR has jurisdiction. 
-After due processing, they procced to a refugee camp in Jammu. However, the regular influx will eventually give rise to logistical problems for India, for it doesn't have the resources to house a large number of Rohingyas.
-should be solved else problem for the the entire region.
-coz youth unemployed so can go toward militant org.
- The need of the hour calls for international cooperation. In the short term, first step would be to recognize the refugee status of the Rohingyas by all regional powers. This is to prevent crisis such as the recent on, where a boat with hundreds Rohingyas on board was found drifting in high sea because no state in the region is willing to accept them. In the long term, the international community needs to make Myanmar aware that the responsibility of the Rohingyas' safety and welfare lies on it.


->India an Nepla

->Sept 2015 Nepal constituion promulgation
-Propose to make Nepal secular ,Democratic and Republic moving away from practice of Monarchy ruled by Hindu king.

why to cheer
-happened Eight years after the adoption of an interim Constitution
-will pave path to becoming a secular, federal, democratic and republican Nepal
-has moved Nepal away from the 1990 Constitution that maintained the state as a constitutional monarchy ruled by a Hindu king
-there has been a degree of closure to the Constitution-writing process
-recovery work after recent earthquake will be more coordnated in a democratic republic as govt will be answerable to people
-At least broder framework has been delivered. whatever concern are there can be addressed by discussion
-Was accepted by most of the  Nepal’s polity — 507 out of the 601 lawmakers in the re-elected CA voted in favour.with 69 abstentions, mostly by legislators from the Terai and rest 25 from opposition dissented.
 
 violent protests raged in the Terai against “injustice” meted out to the Madhesis
 
why recent violence clashes
-Mainly by Madhesi 
-protestors were upset that the federal restructuring of Nepal into seven provinces left the Madhesis divided among five provinces, with only one of them having a majority of plains-origin people
-delineation of electoral constituencies in the Terai (where more than 50 per cent of Nepal’s people live) which has not been done on the basis of the population in the plains.his creates a grievance about gerrymandering (dividing seat in a way to give one political party majority in many seats.)
other concern
-disallow children of Nepali mothers married to foreigners from inheriting Nepali citizenship


The leaders of the three main political parties — the Nepali Congress, the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) and the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) — have affirmed that the federal boundaries could be changed later.But it is question of concer that why after so many year of discussion question of Madhesi was not addressed.


->W.r.t India role inconsti process
India has played an important role in framing of Nepal’s constitution by ensuring law and order and reconciliation between political factions but it may have to increase its efforts and influence since:

1.	Violence along border: the madhesis have taken route of violence in Terai making India’s border insecure. Also it could unleash similar riots in adjoining areas of Bihar.
2.	Ethnic ties with India: The madhesis and tharu ethnic minorities making 40% of Nepal’s population share a close ethnic tie with India and thus India is concerned about their political marginalization.
3.	India’s loss and China’s gain- India was assured that all factions would be taken on board but madhesis were left out, this depicts the loss of indian influence in Nepal politics. It also shows the increasing influence of CPN which have ideological links with China. Nepal should be the last country India can afford to become a part of string of pearls.
4.	Bihar elections: Bihar’s lawlessness can be aggravated by this violence and this may increase threats like smuggling, human trafficking and cross border terrorism via Nepal.


->India and Netherlands 
-have shared cordial relations since Independence. The relations between the two nations have focused on economic and commercial aspects instead of a strategic outlook. However, even that has been changing in the recent past.

1. Counter Terrorism - India and Netherlands have set up a joint working group on counter terrorism. This would help the two nations learn from each other's experience. While India has a long history of tackling terrorism, Netherlands is a part of the coalition that is fighting the ISIS.

2. Trade - Bilateral trade between the two nations was around 6 Billion Euros in 2014-15. Also, India was the fifth largest investor in the Netherlands.

3. Renewable Energy - Netherlands has long experience in harnessing wind energy. Thus the two nations can collaborate in this sector as India attempts to increase the contribution of clean energy for sustainable development.

4. Strategic Ties - The Netherlands supports a permanent seat for India at the UN Security Council.

5. Water management - Netherlands is a country whose significant area lies below the sea level. Hence, it has faced devastating floods. India can benefit from that experience to tackle the problem at home.

6. People to people contact - Netherlands is a popular tourist destination for Indians. The Indian government is also trying to attract the dutch tourists by including Netherlands in the e-visa scheme.

Thus, relations between India and Netherlands have been cordial and warm. However, there is a lot potential to further strengthen the relationship.

->India and north korea

Relations between India and North Korea (DPRK) have been generally characterised by friendship, cooperation and understanding. Besides Buddhism being a common historical link, the two nations, both members of NAM, share commonality of views on many international issues including disarmament and south-south cooperation. The existing bilateral relationship is characterised by:
(A) India happens to be one of Korea's largest trading partners with bilateral trade standing at $500-million annually.
(B) India is increasing providing DPRK ITES assistance by way of scientific and computer training
(C) India as one of the leading contributors has been extending humanitarian assistance to DPRK, which has suffered food shortages during the last few years
(D) Cultural exchanges between the two countries has been a regular feature
-But india has discouraged ministerial interaction with North Korea traditionally as a punishment for North’s ties with Pakistan(including weapon trade)  and not to offend sourth korea as both north and south Korea are arch rival.
- Also, India is a strong supporter of the reunification of Korea. On the other hand, India condemns NK’s regular nuclear tests and also supported UN operation in NK during the Korean War

->Current relation
-MOS HOme was sent to the North Korean embassy is good gesture 
-“North Korea is an independent country and a member of the United Nations and we should have good bilateral trade ties,” Mr. Rijiju said.
-Mr. Rijiju has become the first Minister from the Indian side ever to address a bilateral event featuring the North Korean flag on the national Independence Day
-in 2013 a 3 member parliament delegation was sent depict India's seriousness to improve ties.
In recent times, India has declared her intention to increase engagement with DPRK under the aegis of India's "Act East Policy". Increased engagement is likely to have the following benefits for India:
(A) From a geo-strategic perspective, India is likely to use its closer ties with DPRK as a counter weight to the influence of its arch rivals - Pakistan and China, both of whom are known to be close allies of DPRK.
(B) DPRK's rich reserves of rare earth metals can boast the growth of India's IT and electronics industry.
(C) Given that India is close to both the Koreas, it could use its good offices to attempt to bring rapprochement between the two - thus cementing its position as an emerging player on the global forum.
--As other nations are also trying to improve ties with NK on similar reasons, India should be an early bird in the initiative, to benefit in the ties in the future

->Why change in stance
-huge mineral and rare earth deposit
-might be a move to encircle china to counter its string of pearl. like seen in recent time India is picting for good relation with all countries in China neighbourhood , like Mongolia , Vietnam, ASEAN and now North Korea

Challenges
While the enhanced engagement is welcome, India must tread cautiously because the increasing warmth in ties could alienate South Korea(this time it was counter balanced by sending Railway minister to sourth Korea to seek technology help in railways) and Japan thereby hurting India's trade interests. Further, given the allegation of human rights abuse under the dictatorial regime of Kim Jong Un, India could harm its international image especially when it is seeking permanent membership at the UN.


“




->1965 war out come and benefits to India [Indicisive , neither pak nor India won]
-the armed forces had begun a command restructuring, force expansion and doctrinal shift process which had given its rank and file new confidence. 
-Indian commanders were new to handling brigade and division-sized forces in battles.

-Indian commanders thus far had experience as battalion commanders in 1948 in Jammu and Kashmir and in 1962. As a result, mistakes were made and losses incurred, which were offset by the gains made by determined combat actions by the Army and the Air Force. The gallantry awards of the War speak volumes for such work.

-A simple soldier from Bihar, Albert Ekka, won the Param Vir Chakra for single-handedly destroying Pakistani tanks
-Major Ranjit Dyal made an intrepid dash against all odds to capture the Haji Pir Pass
-heroes like the Keelor brothers, Denzil Keelor and Trevor Keelor, and others, who used their old and outgunned aircraft to bring down the famed U.S. made Sabres
-Outmoded tanks of the Indian armoured division halted Pakistan’s Patton tank-led offensive at what later became known as a graveyard of tanks.

-new military leardership and political maturity emergy
-Execution of a smooth cohesive war-plan by better cordination mechanism b/w 3 service  and with political structure to achieve comman wargoals.
- The role of technology and modern armament systems in the outcome of wars was carefully observed and built into military doctrines
-deeply-imbibed lesson that valour and heroism alone do not win wars against superior weapons and organisation
-China in 1962 and Pakistan in 1965 both contributed to the coming of age of India’s politico-military thinking.
-1971 war victory was a reflection of experience gained during 65 war.

Strategy for 1971

-. Six years after the 1965 War, despite massive political developments in the country, a new military leader in Pakistan preferred to exercise the military option in 1971 in what was then East Pakistan. 
-The Indian response was based on its 1965 experience. India quickly ensured the strategic imperative by a Treaty with the Soviet Union
- and prepared for a military conflict to create conditions in East Bengal for the return of ten million refugees who had poured into India.
 
1971 war effect
-The 1971 War became a game changer in strategic and geopolitical terms and reconfigured the power balance in South Asia.
-Security threat due to east pak almost eradicated
-Refuge problem in india due to 71 conflict solved
-anti India activities from East pak stopped.

Current Situation.
-It is sad that the attraction of a military option still prevails in Rawalpindi, as was seen in recently Siachen and Kargil. It acts as a continuing backdrop to relations between the two countries. The backdrop is made more complex by the presence of nuclear weapons and the continued use of terrorism in Pakistan. While these have not held 
-back India from its growth into a better economy and as a stability provider, they have created substantial socio-economic and strategic dilemmas for Pakistan.

The three wars of 1962 with China and 1965 and 1971 with Pakistan are better viewed through the perspective of a strategic continuum. Each of these wars had its share of valour but also of tragic loss of lives of its men and officers. Wars are more than the sum of the battles, valour and sacrifice.

 The 1971 War was a decisive one. It led to the creation of a new nation, for a people who wanted to constitute one. The War of 1962 has left the legacy of an unsettled and disputed border, which is prone to frequent military confrontation. There is little prospect in the foreseeable future of a final settlement.

The War of 1965 has had no decisive outcome either in Jammu and Kashmir or in the overall relations between the two countries. 
In fact, there has been no decisive war after 1971, despite massive military power used by major powers in different parts of the world. The after-effects of human migrations and the rise of armed groups threatening global security have been the legacy of indecisive wars. Armies can win wars but the gaining of peace is a different thing altogether. It is something to ponder over, as we commemorate the 1965 War.

->India Pak
->Gilgit-Baltistan 
-was a region of princely state of india ruled by maharaja hari singh
-northernmost administrative territory of Pakistan. 
-region together with Azad Kashmir is claimed to be "disputed" by India and Pakistan
-PAK SC dont recognize as part of pak and being maintained as autonomus region
-borders Azad Kashmir to the south, the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the west, the Wakhan Corridor of Afghanistan to the north, the Xinjiang autonomous region of China to the east and northeast and Jammu and Kashmir to the southeast.
importance
- NJ9842 where the Line of Control between India and Pakistan ends lies here.The demarcated ceasefire line under this agreement between India and Pakistan. siachen is just northeast to the point NJ9842.Many conflict with pak..
-Wakham corridor of Afghanistan
-Karakoram pass (linking pakistan to China situated here)The active presence of china in karakoram pass and along the line to pakistan throughout various development projects is a matter of concern for Ind
-China--Pakistan Economic Corridor connecting gwadar port in balochistan that passes through gilgit or karakoram or siachen which have positioned here
-State and non state contributed terrorism
-Voice of democracy - The independent voice in this region is dominated by pakistani government for long time.
-India can take initiatives to give a better voice of democracy to this region.
-Communal conflict ->This region has been used by various successive governments as a ground to itch communal conflict between shia and sunni for political purpose.can have trickle down effect on India too-

Siachen
-2nd largest non polar glacier in world.
- Prior to 1984, neither country had any military forces in this area
-1984 India's operation meghdoot give it control over entire siachen area and its tributories.
-Pakistan controls the glacial valleys immediately west of the Saltoro Ridge
--India has categorically stated that India will not pull its army from Siachen until the 110-km long AGPL is first authenticated, delineated and then demarcated,[21][22] as the 1949 Karachi agreement clearly stated that the cease-fire line (CFL) would continue beyond NJ9842, “thence north to the glaciers.”[23][24][25][26] According to the Indian stance, the line of separation should continue northwards along the Saltoro Range, to the west of the Siachen glacier beyond NJ9842
-Peace park proposal by environmentalists and peace activists
- east and west of the Siachen region have already been declared national parks: the Karakoram Wildlife Sanctuary in India and the Central Karakoram National Park in Pakistan

->India_sourth KOrea
-There are various untapped areas where both countries can cooperate each other for the benefit of the citizens. On India’s part, the following measures can be taken:
1. Take concrete steps to streamline the initiatives taken for Ease of doing business in the country, for South Korean companies.
2. Achieve consensus on policies regarding China and japan, which can help in creating a regional bloc, increasing the trade initiatives.
3. Can initiate Make outside India in SK. China and SK have an FTA, by which Indian products produced in SK, can enter Chinese market much easily then through India.
4. Can increase promotion of India as a tourist spot for SK citizens
5. Should encourage SK to allow more Indian imports, increasing Indian companies penetration in SK, and also allow technology transfer in defense industry

--Benefits for India after such initiatives include:
1. The technology transfer from South Korea can help India in its manufacturing sector’s development through make in India
2. More Indian export to SK, will help in filling the increasing trade deficit against India, in the bilateral relations.
3. Will help in improving India’s shipbuilding sector, which has obsolete equipment and management techniques
4. The SK technology can help in building a cheaper nuclear plant
5. The Visa on Arrival initiative will help in increasing tourism from SK to India.
6. The MoU in railways sector will help in increasing technical capability, modernisation and securitisation of the sector


->India Sweeden
-The ties between India and Sweden were established in 1949 and are founded on shared democratic values.
1. Cooperation in health 
Under the MoU on Health Care and Public Health signed in February 2009, the two sides agreed to pursue cooperation in many area.
scope in control of communicable diseases and antibiotics.
2. Cooperation in Environment 
on sustainable urban development, integrated solid waste management, air and water quality management, clean production ,climate change.
The areas of future collaboration include application of cleaner technology
and Zero discharge in Paper and Pulp Industry; joint work in e-waste management, 
3. Cooperation in Renewable Energy 
Nearly 48% of Sweden's energy comes from renewable sources with wind power alone accounting for over 3 percent of electricity use. MOU signed in April 2010, corporation started  on Solar Energy, Hydrogen/Fuel Cells, Geo-thermal, Small Hydro and Clean Energy.
4. Science and Technology Cooperation 
With India’s large pool of skilled scientists and Sweden’s strength in innovations, good scope.. Some area: assessment of food quality; development of wireless sensor based experimental prototype, energy management and structural health monitoring.
5.electricity infra
Sweden is also a leader in smartgrid technology and as a result its T&D losses are in single digits. ours is 35%. so we can leverage their expertise.
-smart cities, make in india campaign and digital india can be the present potential areas of cooperation


->-annual Report for 2015 of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) places India in a group of 30 countries that meet “a systematic, ongoing a standard for failing to protect religious freedoms.
-raise issues of religious intolerance and advise adressing them with US official help
-
-Unilateral report without having any representation from the countries being reviewed.so give one side story
-Ignore our long religious harmony and diverse culture.
-seems to be politically motivated, some schoolar seeing it as reaction to Govt ban on many foreign funded NGOs.
-selectively uses recent facts like Ghar Wapasi, attacks on minorities etc. while ignoring the years of calm and peace 
- It also adopts a isolationist approach, ignoring the secular character of the constitution and the protection given to the minorities in the constitution 
-Being a govt body commision should have taken up a more balanced view based on sheer facts and considering various factors

-Though, the report may be faulted for its methodological and isolationist approach, India should not ignore the larger concerns of communal harmony
-Whole world is watching us and we should live up to that expectation.
-Events like forceful conversion and attacks on religious institutes should be investigated and culprit should be brought to book speedly to set an example.
-Hate mongerer irrespective of which political org they belongs to should be dealt according to law of the land.


->Indo US defence ties
-The import of US military equipment has grown from zero during 2001-02 to around 9 billion at present 
-Defence Agreement Framework of 2005 [despite its flounders] which has also been renewed from 2015 for 10 years.
-The Defence Trade and Technology Initiative [DTTI] of 2012 with its 4 Pilot/Pathfinder Projects is the driving force of the cooperation
-purchase of weapons, transport aircraft, maritime surveillance aircraft, engines for Tejas etc
-Cooperation in counter terrorism, information sharing, military exercise [Largest] also finds mention
- Maritime security is one major cooperation which requires India’s unequivocal role especially in Asia-Pacific
-Joint military excercise,joint anti piracy operations
