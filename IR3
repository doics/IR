->  While the differences between India and the U.S. over intellectual property rights (IPR) have threatened to derail economic relations, it should be possible to sort them out through discussions. One encouraging sign is the decision of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) not to designate India a Priority Foreign Country (PFC) on account of alleged “deterioration” in its environment for IPRs, in its Special 301 report released on April 30. That label is reserved for the worst IPR offenders. As a follow-up to such a designation, the U.S. could have imposed trade sanctions such as withdrawing preferential tariff for India’s exports. In an election year India would most likely have retaliated through anti-dumping duties or tariff hikes on U.S. imports. The consequent allround deterioration in economic relations between the two countries is something both countries can ill afford. However, while there has been a distinct softening of the U.S. position, India still faces the possibility of a downgrade later this year. The USTR, which has retained India on the less-serious Priority Watch List, says it will conduct a mid-year review. India’s response has been measured. The Commerce Secretary has said that India will not be a party to any unilateral investigation by the U.S. but is prepared to discuss the matter on a bilateral basis.

The disagreement between the two countries over IPRs goes back to 1994 when at the Uruguay Round of trade talks India and a few developing countries managed to incorporate a few flexibilities in the TRIPS (Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) Agreement. However, since 2005 when India incorporated patent protection into its domestic laws, it has made use of the flexible provisions only twice. In March 2012, a compulsory licence was issued to an Indian manufacturer of a cancer drug whose patent-holder, the German multinational Bayer, had priced it well beyond the reach of a majority of Indian patients. The second case involves the denial of patent on a drug to the Swiss company Novartis on the ground that only incremental innovation was involved. The 2006 decision of the Indian patent office was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2013. Clearly it is not these two instances but the possibility of other countries emulating India that has rattled big pharma, whose influential lobbies have been in the forefront of the moves against India’s IPRs regime. The IPRs regime itself is fully compatible with the rules of the World Trade Organisation. It is noteworthy that at the hearings before the U.S. Trade Commission three of the world’s largest corporations claimed that they faced no significant IPR violations in India. On a strong wicket, India should present its case effectively to counter the pressure from the U.S. lobbies.


-2015 USTR again put india in priority watch list
-review done for 72 partner countries.
-has refrained from imposing an out-of-cycle review (OCR) of India's IPR laws, unlike last year.
-annual report on IPR lauded the efforts of the NDA government towards "increased bilateral engagement
-India's draft IPR policy, announced last year, was silent on the issue of compulsory licensing in pharmaceuticals, for which Indian IPR laws were criticised by the West .like in Bayer's  case indian authority order NATCO a compulsory licence to manufacturer Nexvar at lower cost and give only 6% royalty to bayer.
-It also did not pay heed to the long-pending demand of a separate court for IPR cases
-Patent Act 2005 also provides for a high standard of patentability like ruling out meager improvement in efficency to renew patent.Exa : Novartis anti-cancer drug Glivec's improved formula was rejected by SC as candidate to renew their patent.

-restrictive patent law has helped in thriving of export driven generic drug pharma industry
-affordability of pharma products and drugs 
-Other countries have also looked at India’s Patents Act as a model
- patent laws in India are compliant with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)
-so govt s	hould not allow any dilution of its patent laws that safeguard the public interest.

->Sri lanka and India
-cordial from ancient time with Buddhism as link and hinduism lanka connection
-now obstacles, due to international powers intervention in the island nation.
-India term old govt as pro china due to following
	->Allowing china to develop colombo port project
	->Docing of chinese n-submarine in Sri lankan water (@ Hambantota port.?)
->New govt trying to revers the earlier damage w.r.t india .folowing suggest
	-> New presi choose India as first forign destination
	->temporary Suspended China's ambitous colombo port citi project
	-restricted chinese n-submarine entry in lanka water.
	-Lanka Agreed to solve Tamilian issueing implementing 13th Amendment
	-	 Signing of Nuclear copoeation agreement with India
	-recent Lankan PM visit to India, reciprocated by our PM’s visit to Lanka, is indicative
	of positive sentiments
-Also following up with China based on a neutral approach
-aspires to team-up with China in 21st century new MSR for its economic development by roping

-Connect links with MSR through sagarmala project and not the other way around.


-New govt in Lanks


-recently Lanka pm visited India (sept 15) on a three-day bilateral visit,his first international visit after taking over as Prime Minister last month
-United National Party (UNP) together with its allies secured a near-majority in the parliamentary election last month. Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena engineered a division in the ranks of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) (former presi Rajapaksha)
-Fractured SLFP not even able to secure 2nd position . The Tamil dominated party emerged as the third largest party and the main opposition in the country

->challange in relationship and cause
-1. Fishing: Due to no demarcation of boundaries on sea, so arrests, clashes and even deaths.
2. Several of India’s projects in Sri Lanka have been delayed due to environment clearances delaying and protest of the local population regarding rehabilitation related problems. This has led to decreasing faith of people and govt on Indian govt and increasing prospects for China. Exa :Sampur coal-fired power plant
3. Until recently, Sri Lanka had been pro chinese and even now, allows China to carry on various projects on the island, alongwith allowing its vessels to dock
4. Implementation of 13th amendment for devolution of more to the Tamils has still not been adequately addressed by the Sri Lankan govt
- India faces regional pressure from Tamil Nadu governments to speak for tamil cause, India voting against Srilanka in UN resolution earlier has worsened the reationship.
5. Dispute over Kachathivu island
6.Economic problem :CEPA (Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement) is under negotiation, but there is widespread perception on the Sri Lankan side that it will only benefit Indian.Both regions very close but still trade not operating to its full potential.

LTTE Problem history and our involvement
-SL has 73% Sinhalese  population, govt policies descriminated against SL tamils and denied them share in governance. (jobs , reservation etc)
-tamils dominated northern and eastern parts started raising their voices
-ultimiated resulted in Liberation for Tamil Tiger Eelam formation which demanded autonomy first and then independence from Tamil nadu
-repression from sri lanka govt so -heavy migration of the Tamilian population into Tamil Nadu in 1983 put political pressure1.plus pressure from indian tamil population
-.GOI did so by providing supplies,military support and other logistics support to them
-Meanwhile LTTE demanded from automony to total independence from SL which threated indian security interest as it might instigate Indian tamils too.
-Jayawardane in 1985-86 invited Rajiv Gandhi intervention so colombo accord in 1987.
-Srilankan government set in motion the process of devolution of powers to the Norther tamil province to provide them with autonomy on the condition that the LTTE give up their violent methods.
-Also require  Indian troops to enforce the surrender if incase the LTTE were not agreeing to the demands
- LTTE unilaterally rejected the demands, and this marked the entry of India into Srilanka's LTTE problem
- Indiangovt sent Indian peace keeping force to fight LTTE.
-Both sides faced heavy casualties, resulting in the withdrawal of the IPKF by 1989
->Consequences
- Indian tamils found it as betrayal part of Indian govt.
-Sri lanka found India in intervening in internal affairs.
-LTTE was so aghast by the decision taken by Rajiv Gandhi that they assassinated him
-Alienation of many Tamils within the country as they saw that indian foreign policy was anti-tamil


->Israel
-in recent election Likud party headed by Benjamin Netanyahu will head the 
new coalition government
-dark clouds over the progress of peace process between Israel and Palestin
-Most party in coalation against granting statehood to palestine
-There is growing consensus among world for the recognition of the Palestinian state.
-UN granted De facto statehood in 2012 by 138 to 9 with 41 abstentions, 
- Several European Parliaments adopted resolutions asking their governments to 
recognise Palestinian statehood
-Palestine admitted to Intl Criminal court
-With increasing instability in West Asia, the space for the Israel's hard stand 
against Palestine is shrinkin

W.r.t India
-Supported humanitarian cause in palestine
-The US president Obama has already said that two state solution for the region 
could bring in stability to the region
-India also supported of independent Palestine even after good relation with ISrael
- India has set up a mission in Palestine and supported its bid to statehood in UN.
-we should walk with caution as Israel is also important partner in defect/economy 
and energy

w.r.t Israel
- India had recognised Israel as early as 1950, it did not have full diplomatic relations with it until 1991
-relation peaks up in 90s with Israel becoming our import partner w.r.t arms, science tech and researchs
-Politically India has usually voted in the United Nations (UN) for Palestinian rights, but the newly developed military alliance has changed the political landscape
India role in Israel ,Palestine issue
- During the pre-independence era, India immersed in the anti-colonial struggle refused to accept the Israeli Zionist viewpoint that Palestine was a land without people. Our position was led by Gandhiji and Nehru.
India opposed the occupation of Palestine by Israel, US and UK
->solutions india can opt
-Bringing both parties on table and agreeing for a ceasefire should be a good begining.
--India, being a mediator during conciliatory process of Korean Crisis, may help to mediate between Israel and Palestine. 
-India has recognised Palestine as well as have relation with Israel which can be used to propose a mid way path settlement crisis.
-Being the second largest importer of arms from Israel India can pressurize Israel to accept UN resolutions regarding the same.
-Employ soft diplomacy to pave way for engagement
between the warring factions
-Call upon the Middle East nations to recognize
Israel and pressure it to come to terms and implement the two nation theory.




->->Indo pacific region increasing importance due to
-Energy security as it is major oil supply route from arab
-US Pivot to asia stratergy to tackle china
-Increasing piracy threats.
-importnat sea line communication in this area
-China's aggresive stance in south China sea and mineral deposits there and China's 'Blue Water' Ambitions
-Trans pacific partnership and other economic reasons

->what india should do

->IRan Nuclear program
-Iran Nuclear programm
-> west is opposed
-Now iran terming it as civilian only but they feat it end up being military. same happen with indian and pak program
-weapon in Iran hand can lend up with terrorist through some proxy country.
-Us fear that it can be detrimental to Israel interests considering the geopolitical 
Approaches to stop
1. Curtailer - curtail the enrichment prog by various sanction and non coperation so that it can't lead to military program . US support this
2. Destroyer : Completely dismantle the nuclear program even if it require to bomb the sites. Israel 
support his view.

Details of the Iran west Nuclear DEal
-Iran will open its nuclear facility to inspetion by IAEA and in return west will take off sanctions
-Centrifuges - From about 20k centrifuges Iran will scale down to 6k centrifuges also will use only 1st gen centrifuge not capable of producing weapons level fuel
-Uranium and Plutonium Enrichment - Iran can only enrich these two materials to energy-grade levels, much lower than required for weapons
- Iran will also have to rebuild its plutonium plant at Arak to only produce energy grade Uranium
-. Stockpiling - Iran has to give up a 97 percent of its nuclear stockpileInspection - IAEA -IAEA inspectors will have access to Iran's nuclear sites, the uranium mines and mills, centrifuge plants, and supply chains







Nuclear Deal +ve for India and World - (Todays new)
-Removal of sanctions -> high growth
-Will help to stabalize region 
-Iran help important to check ISIS threat
-IRan can play important role in solving Iraq crisis as both have good relations.
-After sanction are lifted India trade can go up.
-With huge oil reserve can better meet energy need of world and stabalize oil price
-its active involvement in intl affair import for gulf oil route security.
-Can help to resolve the palestine issue (?)
-India's investment in Iran infra can bear real fruit only in Integrated Iran.



->ISIS

Why people attracting to it from Asia/Africa
-In IRAQ and Egypt many people protest was crushed by Armed forced with firm hand, which caused discontent among many youths
-harsh repression of ordinary grievances — whether amongst the people of al-Hawija, who camped out against corruption and violence, or amongst the oil workers of Libya, who had demonstrated for better wages and working-conditions


ISIS Kurd people role
-a western coalition has attempted to counter the IS through air strikes, some success has been achieved by the Kurdish People's Protection Group (YPG) which has fought to maintain the integrity of the Kurdish region.YPG is  armed wing of Kurdish Regional Govt(KRG).
-Kurds are social liberals with a commitment to gender equality and secularism 
-Kurdish movement aims to attain autonomy and ultimately an independent state comprising of Kurdish regions in Iraq, Syria, Turkey and Iran. so seen as secessionist movement by these conuntries
--After saddam hussain removal from iraq they enjoying semi autonomy but they want full autonmy.

->W.r.t ISIS
-YPG's soldiers capturing areas which were previously occupied by IS.
-liberal social outlook can help to garner people support
- (YPG) and ISIS cadres share same religion, culture and belief systems. But they differ in their ethnicity and ideology

->W.R.T India
-due to close relation with Iraq we supported unified iraq and avoided kurd contacts
-But ISIS threat is forcing india to change its opinion.It also offer below
	-Kurd region has good oil reserve
-	-Good economy
	-relatively stable
	-prominent role of Kurds in fighting IS
	-around 25 million indian work in gulf so important to secure their remittances

->ISIS -Sykes-Picot Agreement (officialy called Asia Minor agreement) [ISIS trying to regain the territory they were promised before the Sykes-Picot Agreement]
-Secret agreemtn signed b/w Uk and France in 1916
-Main objective was to secure trade route as before that  Arab world had a united Islamic State led by a religious leader: the Ottoman Empire, the caliphate
-UK/France belive that Ottoman empire can shut down their trade route and cripple economy
-UK sent army officer   T.E. Lawrence to convince the arabs to fight against Ottoman empire.
-He succeeded after promised the Arabs rule over a new united Arab kingdom of greater Syria — which encompassed present day Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and parts of Iraq and Jordan
-But UK and France aim was not to unite arab but devide them to secure trade
-So by sykes-Picot agreement they divided the arab regions among them so that their allies can control them.
->After arab war british mandate for palestine
The area east of the Jordan River was called Transjordan, and the area west of it was a land for the Jewish people.
->=But recent ISIS victory not like its redrawing boundries as in colonial ear. Reasons are
-Comman junta will resist this change
-Rules will be discomfortable with new equation so will resist
-region is internationally important (oil reserve etc) so they won't let it happen
-Many arab states are advance economy and military strong so capable of resisting ISIS.
-But regional reconsolidation like formation of kurdistan may happen as world see them potent to counter ISIS expansion and their liberal and secular outlook will lend them world support.


->Govt and Citizen effort to stop this
-The recent example of a Delhi Hindu girl trying to join ISIS and motivated by its online radicalized material is cause of concern
-she waas stopped by IB and police by timely tip off by his father
-She was de radicalized after IB councling.


what can be done
-Govt strict vigil and coop with countries used as entry point. Deporting of suspected youth by saudi arabia is good thing (recent deportation of the Kerala youth, who have allegedly link with Islamic State, from UAE)
-parent should be active
-high time to setup nat cyber cordination centre  diff should be removed by consultation amid all stakeholders
-religious leader should be roped in
-ground level input gathering
-providing employment
-citizen has to act swiftly , should inform agencies if they suspect anything wrong.
-facebook coming with dislike button, radical can be defeated by disliking the thing.
-citizen should actively expose inhumane side of ISIS like treatment to women etc.





->Ans: Japan recent decision to end education in the social sciences, the humanities and law symbolises the knee jerk response to rescue the ailing economy.

Since the turn of century Japan economic growth rate is decelerating, its GDP is almost stagnant and productivity improving at snail pace. Japan economy is continuously slipping to lower pedestals. To correct this Japan believes that a manufacturing boost by promoting technical education and banning humanities is necessary.
-As the decision is non binding in nature, it has been refused by the top universities of the country but still some schools adopting as govt has urged them .

This decision lacks wisdom because:
(a) Humanities education develops reasoning and interpretation of human behaviour. Both are required to evolve society to next level.
(b) Major historical revolutions that changed the face of society are linked more with humanities ideas than with technology.
(c) Not all students have similar level of IQ needed for technological education. Those blessed with humanities IQ will be deprived of
the opportunities.
-It will have disastrous effect on backward section of society as totally going with science might not go well with them considering the resources and exposure they have.
-Humanity and science criss cross each other rather than standing aloof. If science give knowledge humanity develop empathy and human values.only science will create robots not humans.Rather an integrated approach is required
-when crime rate is reaching at its crescendo , removing humanities will be a negative catalytic step

Such decision comes with it consequences that are more disastrous like:
(a) Diversity in intellectual faculties and personality development of Japanese will be lost.
(b) A substantial knowledge of history and culture will face the risk of being forgotten.
(c) Japan contribution to global culture will be minimum affecting its soft power diplomacy.
-Minority and backward section might get alienated from main stream.
In the quest to emerge as global manufacturing hub and under the duress of demographic dividend, the pressure for skilled manpower will be enormous on India, but it should avoid a move like Japan. India is not just about economy, it’s also a cultural repository of the world. Such derogatory step will inhibit knowledge creation. Yoga, Ajanta murals or the Vedic philosophies which the world admires can never be created in future if humanities are banned. Hence India should balance and promote both humanities and technical education.

->Boko Haram had already killed over 80 schoolchildren in the previous ten months, and its campaign to make Nigeria a hardline Islamic state has cost 1,500 lives this year alone.

Two terrible events indicate a deepening political crisis in Nigeria. The first occurred on the night of April 14, when the extreme Islamist group Boko Haram abducted 276 girls from the government secondary school in the north-eastern district town of Chibok; the group seized eight more girls from another village on May 5. In the second atrocity, also on May 5, Boko Haram slaughtered 300 people in a 12-hour attack on Gamboru Ngala, a border town undefended because troops were elsewhere in the region. There was local resistance; in Chibok, 15 soldiers fought the attackers for five hours, but no reinforcements arrived despite prior warnings from neighbouring villages. Parents and others chased the abductors into the forest, and 55 girls managed to escape, but the area is hilly and densely forested. Two weeks later, villagers near the border with Cameroon reportedly saw 11 trucks carrying a large number of girls, and local intermediaries say two of the girls have died from snakebite. Boko Haram had already killed over 80 schoolchildren in the previous ten months, and its campaign to make Nigeria a hardline Islamic state has cost 1,500 lives this year alone, including Muslims and Christians alike. The sect leader Abubakar Shekau has said in a video that he will “sell” the kidnapped girls.

Boko Haram’s methods are similar to those of the Ugandan Christian sect the Lord’s Resistance Army, which in the 1990s kidnapped girls to be sex slaves for its soldiers and boys to be child soldiers. Yet the Nigerian federal government in Abuja has responded sluggishly. President Goodluck Jonathan took nearly a fortnight even to acknowledge the abductions, which he eventually did in the light of international outrage (the Pakistani daily Dawn, for example, bluntly condemned the kidnappings). Secondly, reliable information is scarce; the three most north-easterly states have been under a state of emergency for a year, and the international airport in one of them, the Borno capital Maiduguri, has been closed since Boko Haram attacked it in December. Tragically for Nigeria’s 170 million people, who have never voted on communal lines, this has helped Abuja avoid accountability and has worsened the atmosphere; the Christian Association of Nigeria has published the names only of the Christian girls kidnapped, saying they had been sold to “unclean people.” Worse still, front-line troops are not getting better training or weaponry despite government claims of increased defence outlays, and police officers say they now have to buy their own uniforms in the market. One clear implication is that corruption and weak public institutions make countries easy targets for determined terrorist groups.

->->Once every five years at the United Nations a conference is held to review compliance with the 1970 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and to advance nuclear disarmament.
-Goals are- Non proliferation ,disarmment, Peaceful use of nuclear technology. 
-Among the signatories of the treaty US, China, Russia, Britain, France are in possession of nuclear weapons
-NPT not signed by India,Pak,Israel,South sudan 
-Iran is a party to the NPT but was found violating the treaty clause.
-North korea withdraw from NPT @ 2003.Israel and North korea are believed to have weapons.
->2015 Conference also failed to achieve due to below
-iminishing authority of UN to prevent unilateral attacks by powerful countries like Russia, US and Saudi Arabia
-Deteriorating relations between West and Russia 
-with the shifting balance of power to China and its non seriousness to the cause (Which reflect in its relationship with Pakistan and North Korea)
-dispute between Egypt and Israel, which was backed by the United States, over banning nuclear weapons in the Middle East.

W.r.t India
-US supported India bid to enter NSG but China opposed it saying NSG should stick to its principal of not including people without signing CTBT. India and Pak has not done that.



->India post cold war era and post 2008 crisis problems and solutions
->Post cold war 
-Balance of payment crisis
-A unipolar world- weakening relevance of NAM
-Collapse of former USSR
-More west oriented power equations (b/w Russia and USA)
-More donimance of western issues like IMF,WB,WTO
-
->Post 2008 eco crisis
-Reducing growth rate
-High Inflation
-Emergence of Euro as EU currency
-Satyam scam
-Slowdown in west and its effect on India
-Increasing asserting of China in Indian ocean
-Reducing assertion of US and increasing importance of Chaina on international level




->SAARC

founded by seven states in 1985. In 2005,
Afganistan applied for membership in 2005 and joined as full member in 2007
observer status include[26] Australia,[27] China, the European Union,[28] 
Iran, Japan,[28] Mauritius,[29] Myanmar, South Korea and the United States.
-New potential member is Myanmar , Russia , turkey applied for observesr status.
- SAARC Secretariat is based in Kathmandu, Nepal.
-developed external relations by establishing permanent diplomatic relations with the EU, the UN (as an observer)

 There are many projects already on the ground, ranging from grid connectivity with Bangladesh to power agreements with Nepal
- Even projects that have got off the ground, like the Saarc University
-The truth is that unless India shows exemplary execution capabilities in infra area, the esteem it commands will be limited,coz infra development has not kicked up .
-Some Opposition party in our neighbour play anti india card so become difficult for governmen to give india a free hand , even trade deficienty is made big issue.
-Nepal still has a political stalemate of sorts.
-Sri Lanka now has a cussedness about regional cooperation, largely buttressed by the view that China can sustain it
-



Afghanistan Pakistan Transit and Trade Agreement 
-APTTA is a trade agreement which provides Pakistan with access to market of Central Asia and Iran, while landlocked Afghanistan gets access to Indian and Chinese Market. Agreement requires transit of Afghan trucks on pre-settled routes along approved corridors and within specified time

-currenlty Afgan trucks not allowded in India through pakistan and has to unload goods marked for india @ 125 km away from bagah border.
-this increase the time and cost of india/afgan trade.

->SAARC Motor Vehicles Agreement (MVA) is envisaged as an agreement for regulation of Passenger and Cargo vehicular traffic among SAARC countries. Only Pakistan among all member countries has not signed it owing to apprehensions regarding type goods that will be supplied to Afghanistan from India
-only 4 countries have signed MVA by now bangladesh, bhutan, nepal and india.

MVA benefits to India
-India will get access to market of landlocked Afghanistan, along with Central Asia and Iran
-better help afgan to revive and fight ISIS
-will revive age old dry fruit trade with afgan
-export agri to agriculture deprived Afgan and import mineral and other natural resources

-eco progress in PAK will discourage youth to join extremist element.

-Can insist Bangladesh to get road access to N.E through Bangladesh ->better connectivity
-ease pressure on chicken neck corridor and do away with security fear of NE disconnection

->South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA)
-Remove all tarrif and non tarrif barrier on trade within SAARC nations
SAPTA was envisaged primarily as the first step towards the transition to a South Asian 
Free Trade Area (SAFTA) leading subsequently towards a Customs Union, Common Market and Economic Union. 
-In 1995, the Sixteenth session of the Council of Ministers (New Delhi, 18-19 December 1995) agreed on the need to strive for the realization of SAFTA and to this end an Inter-Governmental Expert Group (IGEG)  was set up in 1996 to identify the necessary steps for progressing to a free trade area. 
-The Tenth SAARC Summit (Colombo, 29-31 July 1998) decided to set up a Committee of Experts (COE) to
 draft a comprehensive treaty framework for creating a free trade area within the region, taking 
 into consideration the asymmetries in development within the region and bearing in mind the need to 
 fix realistic and achievable targets.
-The SAFTA Agreement was signed on 6 January 2004 during Twelfth SAARC Summit held in Islamabad,
 Pakistan. The Agreement entered into force on 1 January 2006, and the Trade Liberalization 
 Programme commenced from 1st July 2006. Following the Agreement coming into force the SAFTA
 Ministerial Council (SMC) has been established comprising the Commerce Ministers of the Member States.
-To assist the SMC, a SAFTA Committee of Experts (SCOE) has been formed. SCOE is expected to submit its  report to SMC every six months. The SAFTA Agreement states that the “the SMC shall meet at least once  every year or more often as and when considered necessary by the Contracting States. Each ontracting  State shall chair the SMC for a period of one year on rotational basis in alphabetical order.
- India and Pakistan ratified the treaty in 2009,AFganistan in 2011

Effect on India
-1) The preferential treatment provided to least developed countries like bangladesh,nepal,bhutan,maldives has in short term impacted its agricultural products like areca nut which can be imported at zero percent import duty from these countries.
2) It has enhance the status of India of non-reciprocity in behaviour among neighboring countries and has paved the way for better regional integration maong SAARC nation.
3) provided boost to its Act East policy,since it paves way for increasing economic growth of North-east region. 
-provides that platform to the INDIA to maintain its trade facilitation with south asia and improve relations 
-
_ve
-keeps essential commodities like agricultural produce, automobiles etc. out of its scope (?)
-Negative list is maintained by nations like Pak ,item here stays out of SAFTA
-As a result south Asia is one of the weakest economically integrated regions of the world.
-Only 5% of SA trade happen with SAFTA. For EU this figure is 40%

->SAARC Initiative for social and economic connectivity.
Past initiatives 
1) Trade relations- signing up of SAFTA and implementation since 2006.
2) Cultural relations- South Asian Archaeological congress, South Asian festivals
3) Setting up SAARC development goals on line of MDGs to alleviate poverty
4) Regional institutions like South Asian university (SAU), SAARC development fund, SAARC food bank
5) Bringing up of semiofficial organizations like SA free media association, SAARC youth festivals and most important of all SAARC people’s meet.
Recent initiatives (salient ones at 18th SAARC summit, Kathmandu)
1) Determination for “deeper integration for peace and prosperity”
2) SAARC motor vehicles agreement (executed as by Varanasi-Kathmandu bus transit)
3) SAARC regional railways agreement, SAARC energy pact for electricity trading.
4) Declaration of 2016 year as SAARC year of cultural heritage and decade 2010-2020 as year of intraregional connectivity.
5) proposal of SAARC satellite (a gift of India).

->Soft Power
-'soft power' was defined by Joseph Nye as ' the ability to get what you want through attraction instead of coercion or payment
-a country soft power rests on three resources - its culture, its political values and its foreign policies.
-India has been blessed with a rich and syncretic cultural heritage. In fact the use of soft power as part of Indian diplomacy had begun even before the term was coined
-establishment was Indian Council for Cultural Relations back in 1950 was an attempt to institutionalise cultural diplomacy by India.
->Potentials
-Strengthen intl ties througn soft power aspect like people 2 people contacts
-Give strength to non state entities like businessman through cultural aspect
-Give us an edge over our compititers
- It compensates for the weakness vis-a-vis 'Hard Power' indicators like economic strength and military infrastructure.

->Limits
-Cant compensate fully hard power gaps
-Concept of soft power dismissed by some thinkers
-According to Nye, with soft power 'no propaganda is best propaganda.' This makes it difficult for nation states to leverage properly
-Can't be used to secure vital interest like security etc.

->Arctic mineral exploration
-Arctic is home to around 1/4th of the world’s hydrocarbon reserves.
-ndia has an observer status in the Arctic Council currently interest only for scientific purposes.
-INDARC is india's underwater observer in Arctic
-to meet energy demand we looking for outside sources. ONGC has established bases across 16 countries to contribute to this demand.
-Arctic also an option but has  both =ve and  -ve aspect.

way forward should be domestic investment in renewable and exploration + joint exploration if required like Sakhalin and arctic cooperation with Norway.
India's Oil & Natural Gas Corp.(ONGC Videsh ltd) has acquired a 20% stake in an offshore oil and gas project in Russia's  far east Pacific waters  in 2001-- one of the largest-ever foreign investments by an Indian company.
-for the Sakhalin 1 project, operated by ExxonMobil Corp which own 30% another 30 percent owned by Japanese consortium Sakhalin Oil and Gas Development Co., Russian state-owned Rosneft and India’s ONGC own 20 percent each.
-The project, still in the exploration stage
-oil that was found is slightly of a different nature than initially was expected,” M. K. Nayyar says. 

-another India’s investment in Russia - Imperial Energy, an independent UK-listed oil explorer  but profibilit of this is concern.
He adds that the majority of reserves have turned out to be tight oil and company is now exploring new technologies to boost production.
-company also faced bureaucratic hurdles when Moscow refused to give tax concessions and did not include Imperial’s fields in the list of oilfields qualifying for the special export duty formula 

->Bhutan Gross national happiness

1) Good governance
2. Sustainable socio-economic development
3. Cultural preservation
4. Protection of environment

criticism
-. Lack of a clear comparison. There is no clear index to compare Bhutan's growth or 'happiness' against other nations. Indexes like the HDI are a better measure in this aspect.
2. Lack of clear survey methodology, makes the Happiness index easy to distort by the government. The Bhutanese index does not factor in the stories of the Lhotsampa, the Hindu minorities subjected to persecution and ethnic cleansing in South Bhutan.
-might not correctly indicate socio economic position of people
- Lack of focus on economic data leads to low development in capital infrastructure. This leads to low employment and increasing dissent among its people

->G20
-created to promote dialogue between national finance ministers and central bank governors in 1999 in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis
- evolved into a high-level forum of national leaders in 2008 when the G20 countries coordinated the international policy response to the global financial crisis. The forum is informal with no secretariat capabilities, and instead relies on consensus agreement of its membership. Collective G20 decisions are implemented on a country-by-country basis
- 2015 meet @  Ankara, Turkey
-talked about intl collaboration  measures like developing the global safety nets to protect countries from negative spill-overs arising from domestic actions
-also  review ongoing global economic developments, growth prospects, investment and infrastructure, international financial architecture and international tax issues
- Other members of the grouping include Argentina, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, South Africa, Turkey, the UK, the US and the European Union.
-Labour minister of G20 also meet to discuss strategies to deliver more and better jobs and policies to reduce inequalities to support inclusive growth.
-Finance ministers of G-20 countries  also reviewed the progress on the G-20/OECD high level principles on SME financing and the establishment of the private sector-led World SME Forum, a new initiative to serve as a global body to drive the contributions of SMEs to growth and employment, it said.
-first meeting of the governing council of BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) also happend on sideline
-The BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) has been conceived as an additional safety net by the BRICS nations to meet the short-term liquidity needs that might arise in the face of volatile capital flows. The total corpus of CRA is $100 billion.


critisim
-
The G20 only acts when there is a financial crisis even after having very broad framework of ensuring economic smoothness , creating jobs etc.

Is platform for india to raise concern ?
in favours
-India raised issue of china currency devaluation ,said that demang is sluggish and devaluation can effect economy.
-it  has triggered a global financial turmoil hurting stock and currency markets worldwide.
-in last meet  @ 2014 Australia india raised black money issue 
- to tackle terror finance and tax avoidance.
-consensus based decision so India has good say
--It involves the Bretton woods Institutions and EU in its discussions to ensure its work is well integrated
-it can help in resolving transfer pricing issues, help in managing sudden capital flight, can help our central bank in policy coordination,

against
G-20 is only a forum, and its actions are not binding on its member nations.
2. G-20 is more of an economic forum and India cannot put other concerns on it, off-late the increasing non-economic discussions have diluted the mandate of G-20
3. The G-7 advanced group of countries still hold a major presence in G-20, and it has been criticised that G-20 was formed to legitimise the G-7
4. Not all nations of the world are a part of G-20







The G20 is best known for its cooperation in 2008 and 2009 in providing finances to manage the global financial crisis. However, the mandate of the G20 is broader than responding to crises. The G20 is concerned with inclusive and robust growth, delivering better living standards and quality jobs, and boosting global capacity to address future adverse economic events. International issues with the potential to affect the global economy — from oil prices to climate change to Ebola — can be a part of the G20 agenda.
The G20 is just a meeting that happens once a year
The G20 operates throughout the year and regular meetings between national finance ministers and central bank governors take place to monitor developments in the international economy and provide appropriate policy responses. Depending on the issue, there are also meetings that involve ministers and ministries of foreign affairs, labour, agriculture, and energy. At the high-profile leaders’ summit, G20 country leaders and the EU Commission President agree on a statement of policy action. In 2014, there were more than 60 G20-related meetings, and nearly 8000 delegates attended the leaders’ summit in Brisbane.
The G20 only considers the opinions of G20 national leaders
The G20 works closely with major international organisations, including the IMF, World Bank, and WTO, and regularly invites other countries and regional groups to attend summits. While governments are ultimately responsible for undertaking G20 commitments, the G20 has extensive engagement with business, civil society, labour, think tanks, and youth groups (B20, C20, L20, T20, and Y20 respectively). The G20 Studies Centre (mainly through Tristram Sainsbury, G20 Research Fellow) is an active participant in the T20.
No-one is responsible for leading the G20
Each year the G20 is hosted by a different G20 member country, which takes on the G20 presidency. The G20 president defines the G20 agenda during its host year, organises the yearly leaders’ summit, and coordinates the many G20 meetings. The G20 presidency works on a ‘troika’ basis. This means the current G20 president will have input from the president from the previous year, and the upcoming president. In 2015, Australia, Turkey, and China will be working together to ensure continuity in G20 commitments and aims.
The G20 is irrelevant
The economies of the G20 countries combined represent 85% of global GDP. G20 commitments involve national government policy decisions, so it is important for the national constituencies of G20 members to be informed of the commitments their governments have made at G20 meetings. The G20’s achievements include mobilising finances, safeguarding the financial system, and preventing trade protectionism. The forum mediated the short-term impacts of the global financial crisis, and commitments to economic growth and employment are assisting countries to manage the ongoing legacy of the crisis.​​
AUSTRALIA’S 2014 G20 PRESIDENCY
Australia hosted the G20 in 2014 under Prime Minister Tony Abbott, with the leaders’ summit in Brisbane on 15-16 November 2014. Australia narrowed down the G20 agenda with a focus on jobs and growth. G20 countries signed up for the collective growth target of a 2% GDP increase across the G20, to be achieved by 2018.  The Australian hosts also made efforts to improve summit procedure, including shortening the leaders’ communiqué to three pages. You can read more about the G20 at the end of 2014 by reading some of our past publications.
TURKEY’S 2015 G20 PRESIDENCY
Turkey has launched its presidential agenda with a focus on three ‘i’s: inclusiveness, investment, and implementation.  Turkey faces the challenges of implementing previous commitments and delivering growth as promised. You can find out more about what the current G20 presidency is doing on the official G20 homepage and in the G20 Monitors. The G20 Studies Centre is working closely with the 2015 T20 leader, Turkish think tank TEPAV.
CHINA’S 2016 G20 PRESIDENCY
China is the world’s biggest country in terms of purchasing power parity. However, it is under-represented in multilateral economic institutions, like many of the emerging economies. The G20 is an important channel through which China can promote its global interests, alongside the new initiatives of the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (AIIB) and the New Development Bank. The G20 Studies Centre will be closely following China’s presidency and is engaging with China experts including visiting scholar Dr Yu Ye.
WHAT THE LOWY INSTITUTE DOES
The G20 Studies Centre provides updates on the G20 and plays an important role in the G20 process. The Centre produces quarterly G20 Monitors that bring together opinions from Australia and around the world to discuss developments in the G20 and suggest policy. It also provides regular commentary through the Interpreter and hosts events around themes of economic governance. In May 2015, the Centre will host a conference on the future of international economic governance and the G20. For updates on publications and events, follow us on Twitter @G20SC.

->Indo Chian war
-AFTER china replic come in 1947 ,india policy of maintaing peace and one of first country to give it diplomatic recognition.
-After coming to power, the PRC announced that its army would be occupying Tibet. India sent a letter of protest to China proposing negotiations on the Tibet issue.[4] The newly formed PRC was more active in posting troops to the Aksai Chin border than the newly formed Indian republic was. India decided to take moves to ensure a stable Indo-Chinese border.[3] In August 1950, China expressed its gratitude to Indian attempts to "stabilize the Indo-Chinese border
-By 1951, China had extended numerous posts in Aksai Chin india focussed to save Laddak from pak
-Later, in September 1951, India declined to attend a conference in San Francisco for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan because China, which India viewed as an important factor in this treaty, was not invited because of its status as an international pariah.[3] In the coming years India strove to become China's representative in world matters, as China had been isolated from many issues. India vigorously pressed, since the start of the 1950s, for the PRC to be included within the UN
-The People's Liberation Army defeated the Tibetan army in a battle at Chamdo in 1950 and Lhasa recognized Chinese sovereignty over Tibet in 1951
-1954 indo china panchsheel principles -> India acknowledged Chinese sovereignty in Tibet ->china didn't objected to machmohan line boundry -> Indo china bhai bhai
-B.R ambedkar opposed to chinese possesion of Lhasa he feared it bring them close to our border
-1954 nehru asked to draw new map with clear boundry,also in NE map sometime north of Machmohan line.new maps also revised the maps to show the countries of Bhutan and Sikkim as part of India
-1656 CIA recruiting Tibet guerrillas to fight china on indian soil
-Indian public was outraged when it learned in 1958 that China had built a road between Xinjiang and Tibet through Indian territory in Aksai Chin (historically a part of Indian state of Ladak
-1956 some china map show indian territory as china , Nehru objected but chinese said it is error and they don't have any such claim
-Dalai Lama obtained in India when he fled there in March 1959
-Nehru tibet policy -china people media think of it as expansionist tendency.
-Tensions steadily increased between the two nations when Mao implied that the Lhasa rebellion in Tibet was caused by Indians.
- MAO accused Nehru of openly encouraging Tibetan rebels
-china believed India  striving to "prevent China from exercising full sovereignty over its territory of Tibet
-In August 1959, the Chinese army took an Indian patrol prisoner at Longju, which falls north of the McMahon Line coordinates drawn on the Simla Treaty, signed in 1914, map (27°44’30’’N), but claimed by India to lie directly on the McMahon Line.[4][9][11][12] There was another bloody clash in October at Kongka Pass[13] in Aksai Chin in which 9 Indian frontier policemen were killed.[4] Recognizing that it was not ready for war, the Indian Army assumed responsibility for the border and pulled back patrols from disputed areas
-On 16 October, General Lei Yingfu reported on Indian expansionism on the Thag La Ridge. On 18 October, the Chinese government approved the PLA's plan of a "self-defensive counterattack" against India because of its actions in Tibet
-However, Mao decided against further escalation because he feared that India would retaliate by permitting the U.S. to station U-2 surveillance aircraft on its territory
-china feared that Us may photograph its nuclear site
-china propose to withdraw 20 km by both from line of actual control , Nehru proposed no man's land
-Chinese studies of the 1990s still maintain that India was planning aggression in Tibet. chinese believed that Nehru was planning to control Tibbet and create greate indian empire.
-China's policy on Tibet did much to heighten the conflict and tensions between the two nations. The perceptions of India as a capitalist expansionist body intent on the independence of Tibet to create a buffer zone between India proper and China was fundamentally erroneous
-false fears, China treated the Indian Forward Policy of the 1960s, which India admits as a fundamental mistake,[5] as the beginning of Indian expansionism into Tibet.[2]

Forward policy

-This has been referred to as the "Forward Policy".[3][6][11][12][19][20] There were eventually 60 such outposts, including 43 north of the McMahon Line
-According to the Indian Official History, Indian posts and Chinese posts were separated by a narrow stretch of land. China had been steadily spreading into those lands and India reacted with the Forward Policy to demonstrate that those lands were not unoccupied.But India believed it was not believed in chinese side in same was China was not beliving intruding Indian side.


->The larger battle behind the crisis is between the royalist-military establishment and urban elites represented by the Democratic Party, and populist forces unleashed by Pheu Thai.

The unrelenting stand of anti-government protestors in Thailand appears increasingly like an open invitation to the country’s non-democratic forces to step in and take charge. The protestors, banded together as the People’s Democratic Reform Committee, have already won several rounds in their seven-month battle against the Pheu Thai party, but their demand for “reforms” before another election is held has an all-too familiar ring: in Pakistan last year, a cleric rallied followers and laid siege to Islamabad to demand that the elected government be dismissed and a caretaker government of unelected people be appointed to rid the system of corrupt politicians before elections were held. It is a measure of how matters have changed in both countries that the Pakistani establishment did not succumb to the temptation, but Thailand may be fast sliding towards it. Last year, in an effort to calm down protestors, Yingluck Shinawatra, who became Prime Minister in 2011 after leading the Pheu Thai to victory three years earlier, downgraded her government to a caretaker and announced early elections in February. Though the opposition Democratic Party claims it has nothing to do with the street protests, it boycotted the election. Pheu Thai won but the victory was annulled by the Constitutional court. Ms. Yingluck remained caretaker, but was last week removed from office by the same court on charges of misusing the powers of her office. The verdict has polarised the country further, with pro-Shinawatra ‘red shirts’ convinced there is a witch-hunt against the party and its leadership. The new caretaker Prime Minister, Niwattumrong Boonsongpaisan, wants to hold a planned re-election on July 20, but the protestors, led by the former MP Suthep Thaugsuban and the Democrats, are firmly against it.

The larger battle behind the crisis is between the royalist-military establishment and urban elites represented by the Democratic Party, and populist forces unleashed by Pheu Thai whose political power is located in the rural areas. The prolonged showdown has had its impact on the economy: investors are losing confidence, more tourists are staying away, affecting a mainstay sector, and the growth rate has been revised downward twice since November. The King and the Royal Thai Army have stayed away from playing an overt role or taking sides in the developments so far, but if the impasse continues, voices that are now calling for a military intervention will grow louder. That would be a step in the wrong direction. The political leaders would be far better off reaching a compromise.

=Trans Pacific partnership (TPP)
-US led Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) which will have 12 Pacific nations [US,CANada,Mexico,peru,chile,new zealand,australia,malaysia,singapore,vietnam,japan,brunei]
-Will cover 30% of global trade

Promoted by US to 
- promote US manufatured goods and counter Chine influence on trade in East asia regions.

->_ve Overall
-CAn create regional imbalance
-Strong IPR can -vely effect the generic medicine industry and overall public health.
-undermine WTO authority 
-WTO is rule based and work on concensus so give developing nation a good chance

-Traditionally our export destinations like US and UK might give preferential access to members of these(TPP,TAFTA), eroding our markets.
-Rules architecture of these groups will place a greater burden of compliance on India's manufacturing and services standards.
-Can have _ve impact on our manufacturing scalling program like Make In India.

=UNSC reform resolution adoption
-G4 (India,japan,Brazil,Germany and one rep from Africa) looking for permanent UNSC seat.
-UNGA has adopted a resolution with Consensus to begin discussion at Inter-government negotiation group (ING) on bases of framework document.
-written submission was asked by UN president regarding next consultation process including issuel like UNSC category of membership,expansion,Veto,regional representation , size of enlarged body,working method and its relation with UNGA etc.
-Having acquired real power(Nuclear), India could as well give up the pursuit of illusory power

-Syria is a case in point. Even as a humanitarian tragedy is unfolding in Syria, there is no consensus in the Security Council on how to tackle it

->It is good step for India
- this is the first time in the history of the intergovernmental negotiation process that a decision on UNSC reform has been adopted by means of an official document
-Adopted by consensus so wider view to reform UNSC prevail , there might be some difference but that can be sorted out with discussion
- Even though US and Russia took diff position in draft they have communicated later on Verbally that they support india's stand
-Clear will shown by UK and France goes in India's favour
-China,Russia and US trid to mild the resolution but didn't succeeded depict India diplomatic success.

->Nothing has moved
-resolution might have been adopted but UN has not moved anywhere closer to an agreement on reform
- some powerful states and groups made submissions, but insisted that their proposals not be included in the framework document so president had to prepare his text in two parts, one containing collated views of a number of member states and another reproducing the letters of others.
-submission by various govt shows that positions of member states remained as wide apart as before
-Opposition from USA and Russia devoid india claim that most permanent member support its	stance.
-G4 include japan which will be liability due to its conflict with China. India and Brazil too have opposition from their regions
-opposition from  Uniting for Consensus Group (opponents of expansion) as gave vague opinion but negative terms and kept out of framework document.
-Even china openly opposed india entry saying time has not come for serious negotiations but will support necessary and reasonable reform. after verbally supporting india cause.
-Russia said any reasonable option of expanding the Council”, but without any change in the veto
-U.S. favoured a “modest expansion”, without supporting any formula under consideration and no alteration on Veto 
-France supported without objectionto Veto
-Britian supported with no Veto.
-The G-4 or any other group does not have the votes to get a resolution adopted by the UNGA
-India’s position on the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and its border “disputes” with Pakistan and China might be impediments
-its non-NPT status came in the way of its entering the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR)
India’s claim to membership


Way forward
-be more inventive in promoting their proposals as  They have already made a compromise on the veto, the claim to which would be suspended for fifteen years 
- The next step will be to accept anything less than permanent membership, such as extended non-permanent terms, subject to re-election every five years or more. 

Conclusion

More than 34 years of struggle with the issue of “equitable representation” in the Security Council has not taken any close. best we can get, if at all, may be a semi-permanent status, requiring us to get elected every few years.its time UN push for it as repoutation of UN itself is on stake . there is a real risk of the UN being sidelined or rival organisations taking over its agenda

. Therefore, it is likely that some changes would be accommodated on the basis of one of the two alternatives proposed by Kofi Annan in his report, ‘In Larger Freedom’ in March 2005. According to this plan, there would be no new permanent seats, but a new category of eight four-year renewable term seats and one new two-year non-permanent (and non-renewable) seat to be divided among the various regional groups. The plan would continue to be unacceptable to India and some others, but it might well be the lowest common denominator to be tried out. But what the UN requires is not a fix like that, but a fundamental change to reflect the realities of the present century.












=Union of Europe like USA
Why required
-will integrate Europe more and common policy will help
-strenght and weakness of all will combine to build robust model of union
-Will emerge as big power on world map
-need to tackle Eurozone crisis as witnessed in Greece recently

->Challenges
-Fear of losing National sovereignty might held them back
-will be hard to make a consensus 
-rich countries wont be willing to take burden of managing poor one.
-Might not go right among people considering the division occurred during 1st and 2nd world war.
-many region has different culture and ethnicity which can create integration problem.
-Migrant issue: Naturally European nations would witness wide demographic changes due to migrants moving to avail better social security benefits of the developed nations in Europe.

EU
-is a politico-economic union of 28 member states 
-The EU operates through a system of supranational institutions and intergovernmental-negotiated decisions by the member state
-The institutions are: the European Commission, the Council of the European Union, the European Council, the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Central Bank, the European Court of Auditors, and the European Parliament. The European Parliament is elected every five years by EU citizens.

The EU traces its origins from the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC), formed by the Inner Six countries in 1951 and 1958, respectively. In the intervening years, the community and its successors have grown in size by the accession of new member states and in power by the addition of policy areas to its remit. The Maastricht Treaty established the European Union under its current name in 1993 and introduced European citizenship.[16] The latest major amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the Treaty of Lisbon, came into force in 2009.


=US_CUBA
Reasons for bad relation
-Cuba, a communist polity was largely seen as the agent of USSR
-Cuba missile crisis
-situation worsened with nationalization of large property of US corporates by Cuba
-post fall of USSR, Cuba had increased it's engagements with neighboring Latin American nations who are staunch opponents to US. This had further aggravated the situation.
- The USA in return imposed various bans.

->Effects of recent trends
-

=Americ Foreign policy toward LAtin America
-earlier stand
-supported dictatorship in LA which can act as puppet in Us hand
-Today all the Latin American countries have popularly elected leaders with mostly democratic polity
- strong economic relationships with different countries around the world less dependent on US
-
issues with US
-source of illegal immigrants in US
- drug dealers, human traffickers etc
-1962 Cuban missile crisist bad landmark in relations
- economic rise of Mexico, Venezula and other Latin American nations has forced US stand change
REason for US mind change
-fall of USSR so no socialism threat in neightbour
-economic rise of Mexico , Venezuela and other latin American nation
-Increaseing hegemony of China/India
-come up regional trade agree exa ASEAN , AIIB, NDB etc.
w.r.t India
-their economy has open up so good for us
-Easy independent relation building as US has less influence now.
-relation would have been difficult with dictators regime
-substantial investments in countries like Chile, Brazil 
-with good will coming in US cuba relation more opportunity in future for us
and hope that US relation with improve with Venezuela as well.

=->WW2 India contribution
The Indian contribution to the WW2 has been undermined. It is ironic that India fought with the allied forces against the fascist powers even when India wasnt independent itself. The contribution of India in the world war 2 are as follows :
1. Military - British India sent over two and a half million volunteer shoulders to fight under British commands against the axis power.
-In South-East Asia alone, 700,000 Indian troops joined the effort to oust Japanese armies from Burma, Malaya and Indo-China 
-when war ended Indian Army was at 2.5 million strenght , largest volunteer force world ever seen.

Indians fought in the European theaters of German and Italy, in African campaigns, defended the south Asian region from Japanese.
2. Economic - Several Indian princely states and capitalists provided economic support to the allied campaigns.
3. Industrial - British diverted a lot of local raw material to assist war efforts. This was the major reason behind Bengal's famine.
4. Strategic base - Strategic position of Orissa and Bengal and even IIT KGP was used by the allied countries to restrict Japan by air and naval strikes.
5. India liberated British colonies like Singapore and Hong Kong after Japan's surrender.
6. Ordinary workers - Chefs, boot makers, coolies played a passive role during the war.

-Some area like IIT Karagpur campus served as base for US troops
-Then Britisy Royal army fought war 

For Russia, the victory over fascist Germany in the second world war is a sacred national memory. For Beijing the Second World War is about the liberation of China from Japanese imperialism. 
-For both Russia and China, their special position in the international system as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council comes from their participation in the victorious coalition against fascist powers German and Japan respectively


-india, however, was torn between ousting the British Raj and joining the larger cause of defeating fascism. The Indian National Congress, refused to back the British war effort after negotiations with the Raj on the terms of support collapsed. Unlike the Congress, the Muslim League did not obstruct the Indian effort and won much support for the idea of Pakistan during the war. 
-CPI initialy said inter-imperialist war but when Russia atacked they called it people's war
-Thanks to the incoherent Indian nationalist response to the war, it got few rewards in the peace settlement that followed. Given its decisive contribution to the war, India should have been permanent member of the United Nations Security Council 


=Bali WTO dispute
-Two issues for india Trade FAciliation Agree and 10% CAp  of total Agri GDP on 
agri subsidy which india gives through PDS,MSP,Fertilizer, Electricity etc.
-Third, agreement to benefit east developed countries.
-Global practice by govt is to procure grains for PDS at market price.but India procure
from farmer @ MSP. thats why this cap was put.
-calcuated at rates of 1986-87
-There was a peace clause agreed upon in the negotiations as a temporary solution to subsidy issues.Temporary Excemption was being given till 2017 ?
=India Stands
-Declared the subsidy cap as too law as it has to feed large poor population.
-Refused to sign Traade FAcilitation agree till permanent solution of subsidy is sought
-If 10% cap should be calculate at recent market price
-The subsidy by USA in the amber box despite being only 5% is much more than what developing countries such as India offer.
-Extension services, R & D, insurance and other services provided by developed countries such as USA and EU are monumental and have an affect on international trade, but they are no limitations on them

-In Aug 2014 as per agree b/w India and us permanent exception given to India till a mechanism is sort out i.e peace clause was extended till a permanent solution is reached.



=Yemen conflict - NOTED
-Shia Sunni conflict
-The Houthis are a Zaid shia group mainly centered in northern part of Yemen, now want to control the Yemen regime
-Neighbour country is Saudi arabi which is backing Sunni militants in yemen.Us is also indirectly involved 
against Houthis rebel
by providing  bombs , information and refuelling.
-Iran is backing Shia militants.
effect
-connects Gulf of Aden to Red sea through which a large supply of oil takes place to Europe and other parts
-Al-Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula(AQAP) will strengthen its base in Yemen by taking advantage of regional
 intervention against Hothis
-AQAP is Sunni Islamist rebillion group
-The Airstrikes by the Saudis and the GCC alliance may lead to Iran pressing more arms and money to the rebels
-The instability in Yemen may lead to IS spreading its influence
-The conflict could also spread into the
-relatively peaceful neighbouring country of Oman, which is a GCC member 
-Saudi and Jordan want to restrict Iranian influence near their borders
-Dominance of saudi arabia and pro west stance would further alienate shia groups
-Yemen could be split into regions with control of diff sections on different parts
